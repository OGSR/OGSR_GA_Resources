		<text>Hey!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_deputy_dialog_1_0">
		<text>Where's the money for the mission?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_deputy_dialog_1_100">
		<text>Find my deputy and you'll get your money!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_deputy_dialog_1_1000">
		<text>OK but don't lie to me this time!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_1_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_1_10">
		<text>Leha the Jaw is my name! These rogues are my crew!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_1_100">
		<text>What are you doing here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_1_20">
		<text>My boys and I are resting! When we're done we'll head to Pripyat!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_2_0">
		<text>What do you know about Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_2_10">
		<text>It's an old abandoned city from the communist era! From history! I reckon it's full of monsters and hordes of "Monolith" fighters now! No one who has gone there before ever returned!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_2_100">
		<text>You think it's dangerous?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_2_20">
		<text>No doubt about it - nobody has ever come back from there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_0">
		<text>You seen any soldiers around?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_10">
		<text>No, I ain't seen any soldiers for a long time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_100">
		<text>What about military stalkers?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_20">
		<text>Rumour has it that they showed up right by the Red Forest, by the antennae! When they were turned off many people went to the Red Forest and further into Pripyat! We've been here for a day and we haven't seen anyone. Someone probably blocked the road here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_200">
		<text>You think the military blocked the road to the Red Forest?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_30">
		<text>I don't think it was the military, I haven't seen any for a long time but military stalkers could have done it! They don't waste any time. They're the no-nonsense types, they work quickly and efficiently in their teams or solo... it's weird that they didn't block the road here earlier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_300">
		<text>Why did they not go to Pripyat or block the road there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_40">
		<text>I don't know. Maybe they're afraid or they're getting ready for something. I can only guess.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_0">
		<text>Maybe you've got a mission for me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_10">
		<text>Well, I have one but it's not easy...will you do it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_100">
		<text>Saying it's not easy doesn't scare me!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_101">
		<text>Nah, no way. I don't have the time!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_11">
		<text>I understand. I'm afraid myself... would prefer to spend some money instead of sending my guys or going myself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_20">
		<text>Good! The job is to find my scouts, Crowbar and Log! They went to Pripyat since I decided not to rush in and sent my best guys instead! Find them alive and bring them here. If they're dead bring me their weapons! Do this for me and you'll get 2000!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_200">
		<text>OK, deal!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_201">
		<text>Not enough. How about 4000 and we have a deal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_21">
		<text>That's all I can offer you for this job!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_30">
		<text>OK, I'll wait for you here!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_0">
		<text>Mission accomplished!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_100">

	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1000">
		<text>Here. Now the money!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1100">
		<text>You're trying to pull a fast one on me. He didn't have anything!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1200">
		<text>I'm gonna waste you right now!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1300">
		<text>If I see you again you're a dead man!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1400">
		<text>OK, I understand. Good luck!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_200">
		<text>I can't give you anything, I don't have any money. You can keep his stuff if you want.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_300">
		<text>I don't have any money! Go away!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_2_0">
		<text>I couldn't find him!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_2_10">
		<text>Find him fast if you want your money!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_0">
		<text>I found your boys. They died but here are their weapons!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_100">
		<text>Thanks, they're dead then. I don't think there's any point going to Pripyat now! There's a problem though - I don't have your money. My deputy disappeared and he had all the money!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_1001">
		<text>OK, I'll find him! Tell me where to look for him. And don't even think about trying to cheat me out of my cash this time!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_200">
		<text>I don't think he got very far. He's probably here or here, I'll mark it on the map for you! When you find him, bring him or his PDA back here!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_2000">
		<text>OK, wait for me!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_2_0">
		<text>I couldn't find them.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Oh, man! Glad to see you! Feel much better now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Hello. Lukash is awaiting you, go to base.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Not so fast, man, we're trapped. I'm here with the guys from about a week, beasts surrounded us. We can't escape!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>What beasts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>Red Forest mutants. Huge waves every day. Look at this mess. We're getting out of ammo, food, guys are almost exausted... You came really in time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>That's strange... Why they attack you like that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>I don't know, but... Something strange here. We came here a week ago, like I said. Came from the Warehouses through Red Forest and stopped here because of strong emission ahead. Made a camp here. There is an entrance in some tunnel nearby, but door is closed... So when we decided to get out of here, suddenly huge waves of mutants started to attack us, one followed by another. We're stucked here! And this place is strange, my head is killing me and those nightmares... Fidel already got sick.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>Yeah, I already noticed something bad here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Right. We believed, that Lukash will send some reinforcements, and here you are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>Reinforcements? Yeah, I guess... Look, is Owl with you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>Yes, he is. As a corpse. Died in first wave of beasts. Let God rest his soul in piece...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>Where is his body?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_13">
		<text>In the tunnel near the APC. Can't bury him because of this whole shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_14">
		<text>He had a flash, didn't he?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_15">
		<text>Yes, he had. I kept it, but have no time to check it out. Wait... What's that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_16">
		<text>What's hapenning?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_17">
		<text>Shit! Scanner indicating mutants again! Stalker, help us to stand, my fellows can barely grab the guns. If you do - I'll give you that flash.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_18">
		<text>I'm with you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_19">
		<text>Reinforcements? Yeah, I guess... Listen, I looked for Filin, but apparently, I'm late...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_20">
		<text>Yeah... He was torn apart by beasts in first day here. Let God rest in piece for his soul...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_21">
		<text>I need his flash. Searched him, but didn't find anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_start_dialog_phrase_22">
		<text>Yes, he worry about you.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Pseudogiants are dead. I hope, that was the final wave.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Oh, man, I hope so too!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Yeah. Listen, what's that the door in the tunnel you talked about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Oh, that... We wanted to escape through it first, but it's closed. Our handyman Che investigated it and said that door isn't locked, but we were unable to open the door.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>I can look at it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>It became rusty, I guess</text>

	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Anytime, be my guest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>May be. As a scout I can tell you that door was opened last time a long long time ago.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mikluha_second_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Need to look at it.</text>

		<text>Me neither.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mikluha_mines_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Oh, man! I inestigated an old APC and found a couple of landmines. You can get them and install them on the road to the camp, you never know what's next.</text>

		<text>Wait... I got it. There is a tale about some strange half mutant - half human creature living underground and reffered as Master. Master of what he is - I don't know, stalkers said that he's master of all Zone creatures. Looks like he can't exit from the underground because of us and he summoned mutants to us. That's why we felt like shit and fought mutants every day. Something like that.</text>
