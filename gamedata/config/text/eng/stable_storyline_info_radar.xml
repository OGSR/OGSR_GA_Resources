Hurry up, if the Granter is indeed in the sarcophagus of the station, then the one who gets there first will get his wishes granted.

		<text>I turned off the Scorcher. For some reason, I lost conciousness just as I did it. Then, I had a dream: I saw again the massive Chernobyl power plant and the sarcophagus. Then a flash. The shining Monolith inside the sarcophagus. I understand that it is the Wish-Granting Machine. A stalker, exhausted and in rags, reaches feebly out to it...a bright flash and I see a fragment of the first dream... A man stands with his back to me and keeps shooting. Someone shouts, "Strelok!". The man shudders, freezes for a moment and then starts to turn slowly...but the pictures slide past, as if a film was played backwards, and I see how he uses his weapon to force the rats back into the station... I realize that I was there. I must go to the "Monolith".</text>

		<text>Found the last flash drive, last piece of puzzle is on its place now. Klondike of artifacts is real and is located in City-32. But it's inactive, it sleeps, waiting for somebody to activate it with special key. Only the one who can pass through all dangers and get the key will be rewarded from Klondike and rewarded greatly! No one knows what's in Klondike but there are unbelievable rumors. So, Klondike's location and key for it are known, let's go to face Klondike!

		<text>I don't know if I was right or not. And I will never know it for sure. But I've made the choice. I hope it was correct. Now, after those mad scientists, who had conducted horrible experiments on humans and nature for many years, are gone... My goal has been reached and my way is over, it seems... But I don't believe the Zone will just disappear and the people will stop killing each other over its dubious children - the artifacts. I'm sure, there are way more than one choices for me to take. As for now, I'm taking another path, and everything will depend on me only...</text>
