        	<text>Hey, Marked One, there're some docs I've happened to filch from the military outpost. Would you care to take them to Sidorovich? But... I have dropped off the briefcase when scarpering from those... And I really am to meet one guy here, so I cannot leave. Can you fetch it? It's behind the southern outpost's fence. You only have to slip accurately across the minefield, get behind the wire via the tree-trunk over there, then along the fence to a pile of garbage... There's a toilet nearby, so you won't miss the place - you'll sense it, ha-ha... Sidorovich is quite interested in those papers, so you won't regret the efforts!</text>
