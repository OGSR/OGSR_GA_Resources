		<text>Excellent. There, behind that hill, is the main breeding ground of those bastards - the "Free" ones - and me and my boys are going to stir it up properly. There's just one little problem. The base has only one entrance and it is well guarded. We thought of busting a hole in the fence, but their sniper in the tower won't let us. I don't want to send my guys to catch his bullets... but you - he'll let you come close and definitely won't shoot on sight. If you take him out, we'll owe you.

		<text>I know, Cap has told over the radio. He's as happy as a kid with a new toy, he's almost dancing. Well done, Marked One. You're a great guy. Just as I promised, here's something I prepared for you from our reserves. It should really help when you hike to the Radar. A couple of artifacts to protect you from impact and psi and a machine gun, also Skinflint and Screw slightly altered a military suit in their spare time. They welded together a "Knight" exoskeleton with "SKAT" body armour, now you have the best of both. It turned out great, almost like tank armour, the only thing is, they can't be separated. This suit will protect you very well.</text>

		<text>How are you doing here at the Barrier?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_2_1">
		<text>So-so. Would it be too far-fetched to ask you to help us get a BTR for the Barrier? Our situation is not getting any better, if you can - help us.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_10001">
		<text>Since you helped our guys at the Barrier, you can count on getting some rest on our territory, as well as our help. Oh, and my personal appreciation - a bit of legal tender for you...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_13">
		<text>I can't right now, I am not ready to go there yet.</text>

		<text>Well, I'll try of course, but I can't promise what will happen.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_11">
		<text>That's all we can do, but at least its has some merit to strengthen the Barrier. If you do it - you will be well rewarded, you're going to the Radar next?  So, I will outfit you like a tank, I give you my word, it will be first class. Before you leave - be sure to consult with Screw, he'll explain to you any nuances about this BTR, and what you would need to get it running.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_10">
		<text>That's the damn task, wow!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_9">
		<text>We intercepted their radio chatter and realized they ditched the BTRs and requested evacuation. A Chinook heavy transport helicopter was dispatched. But it never left the Dead City - whether they were picked up or not and what happened, is not clear. It probably crashed. Basically, Marked One, I want you to go there and look for the expedition's BTRs, find one at least and inspect in what condition it's in. Perhaps it will be in a decent enough state to bring it here. Then we would be able to put it to good use defending the Barrier - you must understand, this autonomous fighting vehicle would help us very much there, as well as preserving lives. If you find a suitable one, but it won't run - talk with Screw, he will help you to bring it to at least a drivable state.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_8">
		<text>Wow, judging by what you just described it is simply some sort of killing machine.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_7">
		<text>This model is not the regular BTR. These machines are BTR bodies mounted on Kharkov tractor chassis. These machines are virtually autonomous combat systems, operated by one or two people. They are equipped with special absorbers for deployment in anomalous fields, and are heavily armoured. The crew sits in a reinforced capsule and view the outside exclusively through a camera lens. The machine is equipped with a powerful on-board computer and an electronic guidance system with target acquisition which is designed specifically for the Zone. Recently these machines have had guidance system upgrades to fully automate them - allowing the crew to concentrate on driving without the need to acquire and fire at targets. This model is based on the original amphibious BTR which was crewed by four people.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_6">
		<text>Not really, please explain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_5">
		<text>Well - about a couple of weeks ago, the military tried to mount another expedition to the Dead City but had to abandon it. They were seriously equipped. The expedition was backed up with a few "Guardian Class" BTRs, you're familiar with this equipment, yes?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_4">

		<text>Judging by the way "Monolith" keep trying to break through the Barrier, we need to improve the situation in some way, especially as we have few fighters. It's necessary to strengthen the Barrier, and to strengthen it properly. For this we need - an armoured vehicle...</text>

	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1_1">

	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_3003">
		<text>Exactly. And I think he will go to his meet some time between 10 and 11 p.m. It's going to be dark enough, so no one sees him, but the night time mutants won't be out yet. Go forth, stalker. After you're done, you will become a member of our group. Remember, you must catch the snitch red-handed! You've got to take him down during his meet, otherwise the mission will have failed.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_5002">
		<text>What exactly?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_5003">
		<text>If you feel up to it, go to the outpost near the Red Forest exit. We've had reports claiming that either mutants or "Monolith" are planning a new attempt to break through there. The guys need help.</text>

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_3001">
		<text>Got any questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_3002">
		<text>Yes. Lukash told me to intercept the Duty courier on the way from Red Forest to the Dead City. Could you tell me the best place to do that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_3003">
		<text>Hmm. Best thing would be to catch him before he reaches the farmstead near the passage to Dead City. Reinforcements are sure to be waiting for him there, so you'd have trouble dealing with them all. Plus, that way you'd have to pass through the village, which is a bad thing. Better go East of the village, and fast.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_3004">
		<text>What's there in the village?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_3005">

		<text>Are congratulations in order?</text>
	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_4003">
		<text>I see you're the right kind of guy! Would you mind doing another small job for me? Get it done and I'll give you my Black Kite. A great piece, and the punch it packs!</text>

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_4004">
		<text>But what am I supposed to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_4005">
		<text>There's this one guy who dug in at the swamp. My boys saw him rushing from the village over hedge and ditch. He must have seen something that knocked a few screws loose in his head. Now he's shooting anyone who comes in sight. You've got to find out what it was he saw, 'cause our people are too afraid to go into the village.</text>

		<text>Got any ammo for it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_400523">

		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_4007">
		<text>Good luck, then. Don't forget - there's an old minefield, but with the help of a few good old bolts you can go around any mine.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_5001">
		<text>So, what did you learn? What happened to that psycho?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_5002">

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_7001">

	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_8002">
		<text>I've got business to discuss. Can you show me the way to your boss?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_8003">
		<text>You want Lukash - he's our leader. Go to the main building.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_9001">
		<text>I see you managed alright. Give the documents to Lukash.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_9100">
		<text>Go to Lukash and make your report, then we'll talk, alight?</text>

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_9101">
		<text>OK.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_0">

		<text>I see.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_2">
		<text>Behave, OK? Got it? Try fooling around and you'll be sorry. We had a slow-witted one here once; he pissed everyone off so bad that we made him take a hike on the minefield - naked. You should have heard Skinflint cursing when that dude's arm fell square on his head! That was something special... yeah... So, you got the idea?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_3">

	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_3">
		<text>No, I haven't.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_4">

	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_5">
		<text>Meaning?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_6">

		<text>Nah, I'm not that appetizing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_12">

	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_13">
		<text>OK see you!... Or not.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_14">
		<text>Okay, let's see what happens.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_13">
		<text>Then try stealth, man. You could quietly sneak in, remove the module, and disappear unnoticed. Don't look in the main building, but around the garages, in theory, the Repair Base should be located there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_12">
		<text>Damn, the last thing I need is another skirmish with the military.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_10">
		<text>Yeah, I do! Well, you're aware that the military are now deployed at the Agroprom Institute. They're not just based there, they also act as a service depot for BTRs in the territory. They'd certainly have a large range of spare parts for quick replacement in the field. Try to search for them there, if they don't have any, then you definitely won't find them anywhere else.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_9">
		<text>Do you know where we can find some?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_8">
		<text>Good question, man. Let me think. So... among other things, BTRs are used to reinforce bases and patrol the Zone. Oh, look, it seems we have an option!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_7">
		<text>Where can we get another one?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_6">
		<text>That sucks, man.  Most likely a faulty processor. I suppose we'll need to replace the control module.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_5">
		<text>Something like CPU_0000 error FAULT.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_4">
		<text>Hmm, yes? What was the error message?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_3">
		<text>Yep. It started, and can be driven, but it looks like the on-board computer is faulty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_2">
		<text>What, again?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001_1">
		<text>Well Screw, we still have one problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Okay, I'll try anything at once.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Well, just make three trips. You'll manage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2_1_1_1">
		<text>Dammit. I have to drag all this to the BTR.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2_1_1">
		<text>Well, here it is. But, that's not all you need. besides the battery, you'll need a repair kit and a can of gasoline. All very heavy of course, but what can you do, it's everything you need.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2_1">
		<text>Hi, I've come for the battery.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000_1_1_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Okay, I'll take rest until then. I'm tired from searching the Garbage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000_1_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Well, about six hours, I think. Go for a walk for a while and get some fresh air, or if you want - get some sleep, or even have a few drinks with the guys. then return and I'll give it to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>How long will it take?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000_1_1_1_1">
		<text>So, let's see... yes, it's suitable. The plates are in good condition, there's no electrolyte, but it doesn't matter, I have acid, I'll rinse it out then refill it. Then I can charge it - so it can be used.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000_1_1_1">
		<text>Here you are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000_1_1">
		<text>Great man, give it here, let me check it out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000_1">
		<text>Screw, I found a battery.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1006_1_1_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>I see, do you mean the Garbage? Well, it's not the first time I walked through there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1006_1_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Unfortunately I don't, I put the last one I had in a buggy. But it's not a problem finding one, there are a lot of them lying around the Zone. Hey, at a guess, search in the landfills. There are many vehicles buried there, and when they left,  they didn't remove the batteries, as they were just as radioactive as the machines themselves. Of course, they will be heavily irradiated, but will be suitable for our purposes. In general, scour the landfills, inspect all the machines, and if you find a battery - drag it back to me, I'll re-charge it and then you will be able to start the BTR.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1006_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Do you have one?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1006_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Well it's not a problem to deal with the damage, I'll give you a repair kit, so you can dolly it up a bit, enough to reach our base. I'll also give you a canister of gasoline. Listen man, about the battery... has it any charge left at all? If I remember correctly, they've been lying there a couple of weeks. Then, most likely, the batteries are fucked. They are a high-tech lithium-polymer battery, and they cannot survive with a charge less than the minimum threshold. Most likely, trying to recharge these batteries won't succeed. We can't get the same batteries, but at least the BTRs starting voltage is standard, we can use an ordinary lead-acid battery to start the system.</text>

		<text>Okay, then I'm going.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_11">
		<text>Well... generally, judging by the intercepted chatter while they were trying to escape, the BTRs could very well be badly damaged, so be aware. So, when you get there, see how badly damaged it is, and if you can't drive it, then come back to me - we'll think of something together about what can be done.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_10">
		<text>That's clear, what else do I need to know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_9">
		<text>Well, generally you should find one of the three BTRs first, there may even be some traces of them left. The Chinook, as I understand it, crashed as it flew away and is lying somewhere in the Dead City, unless of course it fell into an anomalous field in the country. Therefore, you need to search there, look - if you are lucky, the key survived  the crash, it's shock-resistant and waterproof.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_8">
		<text>Yeah, now I just have to find the commander's key.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_7">
		<text>Well, we've all listened to the intercepted chatter of the expedition during its demise, in short, those who survived tried to evacuate by helicopter - a Chinook heavy transport, but it didn't depart from there. It seems, it had the commander of one of the BTRs on board, so he had to have a key. Well, in short, the key is, a small wireless transmitter, it sends a special encoded radio signal. When a person with this device approaches the BTR, a signal is sent, and the hatches are unlocked automatically.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_6">
		<text>How do I drive it? Where do I get a key?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_5">
		<text>Yes, that's some harsh crap you signed up for, man. These BTRs that Lukash has probably already told you about, generally have a completely automated control system. They automated everything they could, including access to the vehicle, you understand. You might find this a little banal - but you won't be able to get inside. It seals hermetically, the armour is thick and dense, and by the way, it can even withstand an emission, and if the hatch is closed, it's only possible to get in using a blowtorch to cut through the armour, and that could take a few days. Well, that's if you haven't got a key of course.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_4">
		<text>Well yes, but he told to consult you first.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_3">
		<text>Oh, all right, did you agree to get it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_2">
		<text>Hi, Screw! Listen, Lukash asked me to get a BTR...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_1">
		<text>Oh, Marked One! A gift, man!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_3_0">
		<text>Look, you still want some vodka?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2_0">
		<text>Screw, are you busy?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1_0">
		<text>Listen, would you happen to know...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1000">
		<text>You got something that's broken, man?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001">
		<text>Broken?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1002">
		<text>Aha, you're not here to ask for my help? Whew! I'm getting sick and tired of that. Soon as something breaks, they run to me and start whining about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1003">
		<text>And who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1004">
		<text>I'm a mechanic. A Mr-Fix-It of sorts... I repair guns and whatever else you bring me. Right now, I'm working on these cars.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1005">
		<text>How's it going?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1006">
		<text>Pf-ft! Nothing but rubbish. I'm totally beat. Listen, you got any vodka on you? I'd, umm... you... want a nice scope? The best optics there is!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1100">
		<text>No.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1101">
		<text>It's your loss. If you have some - come in, don't be a stranger.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1102">
		<text>OK.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1200">
		<text>Here, take it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1201">
		<text>Well, thanks! How nice of you. Now I'll have something to help me relax later on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1202">
		<text>Good luck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000">
		<text>Don't distract me, I'm thinking...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_4">
		<text>No way, did you really bring vodka?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1001">
		<text>What is it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1002">
		<text>Here's a tricky question - where do I go for things like artifacts and weapons?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1003">
		<text>You come to me, with money. Or go to the village and get them for free, but the risks are much higher.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1004">
		<text>The village?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1005">
		<text>The village. It's full of anomalies - rookies stumble on them all the time. Our guys just left to go there, you can join them if you want.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1006">
		<text>Got it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_2001">
		<text>What good things did you bring me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3001">
		<text>What will you be needing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3002">
		<text>Nothing... just looking around.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3003">
		<text>You should do something useful instead. Specially as I've got something you might be interested in... Want to earn, huh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3004">
		<text>Interesting...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3005">
		<text>I can give you a Crystal if you do me one particular favor. A nasty situation has developed... Lately, no one has been bringing any artifacts from the village - they are too scared. They say bloodsuckers have settled in there. These days, I can't even send anyone - in fact, I'm that close of asking Duty for help!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3006">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3007">
		<text>A couple of guys went to the village and didn't come back, and the other three are just sitting there on the outskirts. If you destroy the bloodsuckers, I'll give you a Crystal. What do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_30071">
		<text>Not right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_30072">
		<text>Hey, it's your call... Sooner or later someone will clear them off. Meanwhile, Crystal is rare and rather expensive, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3008">
		<text>I'll do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3009">
		<text>Oh, that's swell. If you find more stuff like this, bring it over - I'll pay a good price.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3101">
		<text>And?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3110">
		<text>They're sitting there, looking around...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3111">
		<text>If you help them in their hunt, I'll give you an artifact called Crystal. So, what do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3200">
		<text>We had a chat and then went on a walk across the village trying to catch some mutant...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3201">
		<text>And? Cut to the chase already!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3300">
		<text>We took down some kind of beast, but the guys went down, too. Right as we came to the water tower, they all grabbed their heads, and I had blood in my eyes, too... That shit bucket affects your brain. I killed the thing, but it was too late to help the guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3301">
		<text>That blows. Murk was a skilled stalker. Damn shame. Well, take this artifact for helping the boys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3310">
		<text>Well, guys went hunting and I returned here...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3311">
		<text>I see.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3400">
		<text>Can I stock up on some equipment here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3401">
		<text>For a fixed price, anything is possible.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3500">
		<text>I've already dealt with them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3501">
		<text>Damn, stalker! You're as explosive as diarrhoea! OK, a deal is a deal, here's your Crystal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4001">
		<text>So, how did the hunting go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4002">
		<text>I killed the monsters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4003">
		<text>How tough was it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4004">
		<text>Average.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4005">
		<text>Hmm, interesting... All kind of gunk is spreading from the centre of the Zone - but where does it come from?.. OK, take this for your troubles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5001">
		<text>But I asked you to zap those bloodsuckers in the village!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5002">
		<text>I changed my mind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5003">
		<text>No problem. Of course, in that case there will be no reward.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5004">
		<text>Fine with me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5010">
		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6001">
		<text>Uh-huh, so, you didn't settle that little problem... Therefore, I'll keep the artifact to myself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6002">
		<text>No arguments from me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7001">
		<text>People have been saying you took care of these bloodsuckers in the village. Is that true?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7002">
		<text>That's right.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7003">
		<text>Was it tough?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7004">
		<text>Average.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7005">
		<text>Hmm, interesting... All kind of gunk is spreading from the centre of the Zone - but where does it come from?.. OK, take this for your troubles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_8001">
		<text>So, what have you brought with you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_0">
		<text>Is there a cook around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_1">
		<text>Sure is, how could we do without one! What the heck do you need him for, anyway?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_2">
		<text>Well, I need a little bit of food.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_3">
		<text>He's in his kitchen. Usually, he sits there and mutters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_4">
		<text>Mutters?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_5">
		<text>What did you expect? A drunk is a drunk. If he couldn't cook, we'd get rid of him a long time ago. He's in the kitchen. I'll tell you how to get there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_6">
		<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_7">
		<text>No problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_0">
		<text>Who's the boss here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_1">
		<text>And what's your business?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_2">
		<text>I've got information for him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_3">
		<text>Lukash is our leader. Go to the main building.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_4">
		<text>Got it. Thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10">
		<text>Same to you. What brings you here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_100">
		<text>Who's the boss around here? I've got business to discuss with him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1000">
		<text>Lukash is our leader, you can find him in the main building. But as you enter, make sure to put your piece away - unless you wanna get shot for nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10000">
		<text>What for?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_100000">
		<text>We had some shit happen - once a killer got this close to dropping Lukash. We stopped taking any risks after that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1000000">
		<text>Got it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10000000">
		<text>OK, you can go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_20">
		<text>So-so. Keep out, don't bother me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_3">
		<text>Greetings.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_30">
		<text>Halt! Who goes there?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_31">
		<text>South African swallow!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_32">
		<text>Ha-ha! Correct! You can pass.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_4">
		<text>What's this swamp nearby?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_41">
		<text>A real radioactive puddle. Better not touch it, or you'll get enough rads to make your navel button unwind. There's a character in the middle of it, doesn't let anyone come close. Well, I can feel for him: who'd want to mix with idiots? 'Cause a normal person would definitely stay away from there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_42">
		<text>Who is that guy, anyway?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_43">
		<text>Hell knows. They say he's one of our folks that's been to the village.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_44">
		<text>What village?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_45">
		<text>Well, there is one little hamlet nearby. Full of mutants and anomalies. I haven't been there yet - I only came to this base just recently. Ask Max - he's been here a hundred years.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_5">
		<text>Listen, where can I stock up on some ammo? Rostok is kind of a long walk from here, I don't feel like going there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_51">
		<text>Go to the main building and you'll find it on the first floor.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_6">
		<text>What's up, rambling man? Looking to drop in at our place, huh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_601">
		<text>Something like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_602">
		<text>How about joining us, eh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_603">
		<text>How about not. I'm here on business.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_604">
		<text>C'mon, join us. It's a lot of fun.</text>
	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_613">
		<text>Will you tell me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_614">
		<text>Yeah, right.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_615">
		<text>C'mon, please let me in. I can't spend the night in the fields, can I?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_616">
		<text>Why not - the weather is fine, almost like summer. Well, alright, if you pass the test - you can go, if not - get lost.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_617">
		<text>The test?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_620">

	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_6208">
