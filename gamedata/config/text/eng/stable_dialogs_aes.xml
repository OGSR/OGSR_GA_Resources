		<text>Is the explosion of '86 your work too?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_chernobyl_crush_1">
		<text>No, we had nothing to do with that. We started our research after the catastrophe took place already.</text>

	<string id="oso_death_truck_0">
		<text>What are the "death trucks"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_death_truck_1">
		<text>The transports we use to send our marked "agents" into the Zone. They infiltrate the stalker community and carry out our orders without realising it. Unfortunately, more than half of stalkers die during transportation, the Zone is very unstable.</text>

		<text>Hello, Strelok. I see you have many questions for me. Well, ask them and then we can decide what to do with you.</text>

	<string id="oso_osoznanie_start_21">
		<text>The choice is yours, Strelok.</text>

		<text>What does the tattoo "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." mean?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_stalker_1">
		<text>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a coded acronym, which we use to mark agents programmed for particular missions. We created a network of psi-fields on the way to the Zone’s center in order to recruit agents. You know one of these fields by the name of the Brain Scorcher. When a stalker attempts to reach the Zone’s center, we acquire control over his consciousness and program him to a specific mission. Thus we influence almost everything that is going on in the Zone and provide security for ourselves.</text>

	<string id="oso_what_about_me_0">
		<text>What happened to me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_what_about_me_1">
		<text>You're a bolt that fell out of the machine. DUring one of your raids you managed to get too close to us. Our protective system was considered perfect, but you found a way to bypass it. From the moment the Zone was formed, many people have tried to get to its centre but we cannot let that happen. Humanity is not ready for the truth. That is why we started programming our agents to eliminate you. Unfortunately, we missed it that you happened to be among the "recruited" stalkers. For some unknown reason the system made a mistake as well and you got the mission to kill yourself.</text>

	<string id="oso_what_is_the_zone_0">
		<text>What is the Zone? How did it come about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_what_is_the_zone_1">
		<text>What you see is the result of ill-considered intervention in the Earth's noosphere. Attempts to affect the noosphere brought about a local crack. The Zone you know is simply the visible manifestation of this crack. The underlying problem is far greater than you can imagine.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_what_next_0">
		<text>What next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_what_next_1">
		<text>That depends on you. The Zone is growing. We're trying to restrain its expansion but humanity seems to be intent on hindering our work. Our resources are not limitless and bodies connected to C-Consciousness eventually die. If you join us, we can restrict the Zone's growth. If you decide otherwise we cannot make a credible prognosis of the outcome.</text>

	<string id="oso_who_are_you_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_who_are_you_1">
		<text>We are the result of an experiment aimed at creating a superconsciousness called “C-Consciousness”. According to our calculations, Earth is surrounded by a special informational field, the so-called noosphere. It includes all the inhabitants of the planet with cognitive abilities. Our main goal was to make adjustments to the noosphere, allowing us to remove things like anger, cruelty, greed and other negative factors from the planet. Individuals are unable to affect the noosphere but C-Consciousness can.</text>

	<string id="oso_why_chernobyl_0">
		<text>Why did it happen here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="oso_why_chernobyl_1">
		<text>It was the best place. After the catastrophe in 1986 there were very few people left in this area and we could work without fear of being found. Also, the power plant provided our equipment with energy. Further, there were many powerful antennae here, which are extremely important for our cognitive optimisation experiments.</text>

		<text>I agree to join the C-Consciousness project.</text>
