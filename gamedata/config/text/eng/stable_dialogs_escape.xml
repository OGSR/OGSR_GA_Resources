        The first day, the first stalker entered the 100 Rads bar swinging his PKM machine gun loaded with a 150 rounds belt of 7.62x54mm, and shouting out loud: "everyone out, fast!" Some of the rookies did run out, but the remaining stalkers quickly and easily disarmed him and taught him a good lesson.
        The second day, the second stalker found a dried and preserved bloodsucker's head somewhere, stuck his own head into it, dressed off bare naked and roaring like a madman, ran into the 100 Rads bar. Most of the stalkers ran out the door, but a few remaining veterans and a Duty squad pulled off the bloodsucker's head from him, and taught him a good lesson.
        The third day, the third stalker entered the 100 Rads bar in his old and worn suit, and with an almost broken AKSU on his shoulder. He ordered a drink, took a sip and started coughing...

The guy listens, learns where the rookie's heading and says: "I am heading that way myself, let's go, I'll guide you." So as they are circling the lake, everything's fine, the rookie feels much better, he starts chatting away: "It must be great to be an experienced Stalker, not be spooked by every noise, not be afraid of every shadow, you don't even carry a weapon." The older guy starts laughing: - "Oh come on, what's here to be afraid of?" - "What do you mean?" says the rookie, "Monsters, mutants...

		<text>So you don't know anyone like that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311114">
		<text>Nope, none at the Cordon. And there's no time to look for someone. We'll have to compose it ourselves.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311115">
		<text>Let's do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311116">
		<text>So, here I have a piece of paper, slightly torn, but still better than nothing... Where's my pencil? So... In short, these thugs need to believe that this "transfer order" is from someone in authority! Here we go: "Hello, you wankers! Hey you! Yes, you! If you don't.."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311117">
		<text>Isn't that way over the top?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311118">
		<text>No, they're bandits, they always try to seem tough. So, then we write: "... release the captive to this guy without delay, or I will personally tear out your eyes and throat, you reptiles. - Borov." What do you think?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311119">

	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311120">
		<text>Well, less words, more action. Here's your coat, and your "transfer order". Good luck, Marked One, may the Zone be with you.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_61">
		<text>Whoa, man! Now that was something! You wiped them out and left nothing for us. I'd never believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes! That blew me away, man...</text>

		<text>So, where are the piles of enemies you killed? You talk the talk, but you don't walk the walk. Get lost!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2">
		<text>Sorry, brother, but could you go somewhere else? I'm here to meet someone...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_21">
		<text>While you're standing around waiting, I've got a couple of questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_211">
		<text>Okay, ask away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2111">
		<text>Fox, tell me, where have you been in the Zone? What did you see?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_21111">
		<text>That's all you want to know? Take a week off and then come back to see me. Look, my time isn't cheap and I'm kind of busy right now. Here are the basics and then you're on your own. About three kilometres North of here, you'll find the Garbage. That's the place they used to dump all the radioactive waste from the station. High radiation levels, anomalies all over the place, so there are loads of artifacts to be found there... but not very valuable. Just beware of the gangs and don't cross the Duty patrols. West of the Garbage is the former Agroprom Research Institute. Little in terms of artifacts there so you can skip it. And to the East, there's the Dark Valley. Who knows... That's a pretty weird place. It seems quiet enough, apart from a bunch of gangsters roaming around. But I got a feeling there's more to it than meets the eye. Oh, and there's the Rostok factory right beyond the Garbage. That's stalker territory. You'll find lots of clued-up folks there, they'll tell you the rest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2113">
		<text>I've changed my mind. Thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_3">
		<text>Thanks. Okay, now I'm listening very careful.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_31">
		<text>The trader told me you might know something about Strelok.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_311">
		<text>Why is everyone taking such a keen interest in him lately? Okay, I can't say I know him personally. We did "communicate" though: my guys took some shots at him once. No one got hurt - it was clear his party had been waiting for someone else, so we parted in peace. Cussed each other out across a ravine and went on our separate ways. Seriy, my brother, is now in the hangar at the Garbage - I'll dish you his coordinates so you two can have a chat. He knows more about Strelok. Be careful at the exit, a small gang has settled down in those parts. By the way, I got a few monsters chasing me and it doesn't look like they've given up yet. You mind helping me deal with them? It's a walk in the park really...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_3111">

	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21">
		<text>Why not?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_212">
		<text>What kind of idiot would chat with a former passenger of the "death truck"? First, you have to prove you're okay to deal with.</text>

		<text>What "death truck?" What are you talking about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21211">
		<text>Ah, hell only knows what it really is. But whatever it is, it's bad, about as bad as it gets... Why am I talking to you about this anyway! Maybe I'm just superstitious, but you, Marked One, should really take a hike before something happens to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2122">
		<text>What can I do to make people trust me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21221">
		<text>Pass the Trader's test while we watch. If you're alright - if you're not trigger-happy and you use your head, then we'll definitely find some common ground. Don't you worry.</text>

		<text>Alright, so be it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_3">
		<text>Hello, Marked One. What do you want?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11">
		<text>Listen up, Marked One, you will come in handy! We could really use some help..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111">
		<text>I'm Fanatic, and I'm filling in as leader since Wolf left. A few mercenaries came by here yesterday... and they were some tough bastards, let me tell you. So, they came here and made a serious demand. They gave us one day to clear this camp out as they wanted to set up their own base here. They're coming back tonight, and as you can imagine, they won't be in the mood for a chat...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111">
		<text>So, what are you going to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111111">
		<text>We're going to set up an ambush because a direct attack would probably be the end of us. They've got the fighting gear and everything, plus they're trained in tactics. And all we've got here are little boys. So, we've decided to just sit tight in these houses and make it look like we're gone. Then when the right moment comes, we'll attack. Fighters like you are just the thing we could use right now. And we'd make sure to thank you properly after it's all over. You know we're good for it! So, what do you say, will you help us out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111111">
		<text>I will.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111111">
		<text>Let's spend the rest of the time preparing for the fight. Here's the plan: I'll put the most hopeless rookies in houses and basements and tell them not to make a move, otherwise they might just slaughter our own troops. You and me and a couple of other decent shots will take the best positions to have an eye on the area around the fire. As soon as they come close to the fire, we let the bullets fly from everywhere! They'll be coming from the bridge... and I don't think we'll have to wait long. So, find yourself a hiding place with a view, then wait for my command. Take a look around, but remember that your odds aren't as good in the open. It's your call.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111111111">
		<text>Well, let's begin...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111112">
		<text>Nah, I don't play these games. No offence.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111121">
		<text>That's a shame. We could really use a fighter like you. I guess we'll have to do it on our own...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_21">
		<text>Waiting for these boy scouts. I got a feeling they're just around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_31">
		<text>You're a real killer, Marked One! I wouldn't want to stand in your way. Ever!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_311">
		<text>Yeah, something like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_3111">
		<text>Here, I hope you won't forget about us. And by the way... a million thanks for the help. We saved the young ones, Marked One.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_41">
		<text>Hey, Marked One, great to see you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_411">
		<text>Hello to you, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_412">
		<text>By the way, where did Wolf go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_4121">
		<text>Oh, he got a message from a stalker who was passing by. He packed his things, grabbed a box of dynamite and went deep in the Zone. I'm still getting back in shape after the wounds I got, so I'm staying at the Cordon anyway so Wolf asked me to look after the kids.</text>
	</string>
	<!-- kamikaze add to wolf start -->
	<string id="military_volk_info_0">
		<text>Well, look who's here! Wolf, what winds brought you here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="military_volk_info_1">
		<text>Skull, an old friend of mine asked for help. He was with Duty, but things got a little out of control - he quarrelled violently with his superiors. He wants to force a resolution with the anarchists but they took away his supplies for disobeying orders and he no longer has access to the arsenal... Well, then, he asked me to help out an old friend - he urgently needed a box of dynamite. It was pretty straightforward, I managed to get it a while ago, but I had another wild goose chase for booty to do here. Well, it was urgent, so I took the box, left Fanatic to look after the boys, and moved here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="military_volk_info_2">
		<text>Tell me. Why the hell does he need the dynamite?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="military_volk_info_3">
		<text>I'll fucking tell you. It seems he was going to blow up these anarchists. He's become so strange lately, he's so fucked up with hatred towards those Freedomers. I feel afraid for him. He's going to get both himself and his boys killed. They listen to him without question.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="military_volk_info_4">
		<text>Yes, I see...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="military_volk_info_5">
		<text>Yeah, nothing good will come out of it. I'll give you some advice, Marked One - stay away from him. You'll be better off, for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="military_volk_info_6">
		<text>Well, we'll see.</text>
	</string>
	<!-- kamikaze add to wolf end -->
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_0">
		<text>I've got some questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_1">
		<text>Go ahead, I'll try to help.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_10">
		<text>Thank you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2">
		<text>What do you know about the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21">
		<text>I know many things. Be more specific.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211">
		<text>What's in the centre of the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2111">
		<text>Wow that's a question alright. I've been looking for the answer for two years. I still haven't found a way to the centre. At least not one I could take and come back alive. My friends and I tried to break through a couple of times. I barely made it back alive, but my friends, well, some did, some didn't. You'll ask why. We were chasing our dreams, trying to make them come true.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21111">
		<text>Can dreams come true?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211111">
		<text>There is this nice story about a Wish Granting Machine. They say there is a place in the centre of the Zone where any desires can come true no matter how bizarre. But you know what? I know for a fact there're lots of ways to kick the bucket in the centre of the Zone, and I don't believe in the Wish Granting Machine any more. Don't take that risk for nothing, I tell you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_212">
		<text>How did the Zone come to be?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2121">
		<text>There was an explosion in 2006. That's how it came about. I know that's not a real answer. Very few know the whole truth, if anyone does at all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_213">
		<text>What brought you to the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2131">
		<text>I used to work at a coal mine before they closed it down. I had no money and nothing to look forward to. Then I heard some rumours about the fabulous riches hidden inside the Zone. I had some experience under my belt, so I thought "What the hell?". Can't say I've become rich, but some cash came my way, that's for sure. This is a typical story; most of us got here the same way...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_214">
		<text>What's the most dangerous thing in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2141">
		<text>Hard to say. There are so many dangers and surprises, you just can't run into all of them. There's more than enough for one person anyway. I got one toe bitten off, my hair is falling out from the radiation, and half my leg got fried in a Scorcher... Things there are real bad. Another time I happened to come face to face with a bloodsucker - that's a meeting I'd like to forget. So, we can talk all you like, but you'll never know until you experience it on your own. The only advice I can give is beware - everywhere and always.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_3">
		<text>Have you heard about a guy called Strelok?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_31">
		<text>I seem to remember he's one of the tough ones. Never actually met the man. Well, I haven't come close to the centre in a while and all we get here is rookies. You should find someone who hangs out deep in the Zone and have a chat with him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_4">
		<text>What do you know about the "Death Trucks"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_41">
		<text>I know nothing and that's fine by me, thank you!  Sorry, I know about your situation. Too much mysticism about it. You spend a month in these parts and you can't help but become superstitious about life. Dead people in the trunk, dead people behind the wheel... Who are they, where did they come from and why? I can only hope they didn't rise up from the grave.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11">
		<text>Hi. Why are you here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111">
		<text>Hi. I need to see Nimble. Would you know where I could find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111">
		<text>Nimble got a raw deal. His group was attacked by some bandits a little ways from here. All he could do was send me an SOS message. It looked like his pals went under. My guys told me these bastards are now at the old car park, the one across the road.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11111">
		<text>You don't rescue your own people from capture? Not what I would call friendly. Or is it that you're just too weak to do it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111">
		<text>I'd bop you one, but what's the use? It's not that simple. I got too few people, and even those I got are mostly rookies. I can't take that risk. If we lose this camp, things will get even worse for all the stalkers out there. And what about yourself? If you aren't too scared, I won't let my pride make me say "No" to a helping hand. So, will you help me deal with these thugs?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111111">
		<text>Think I could do it alone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11111111">
		<text>Nope, you stand no chance by yourself. My scouts out there are good soldiers and right now they're near those freaks. Together you can pull it off. What do you think? You got the guts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111111">
		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111111111">
		<text>Way to go! Alright, I'll give you the guys' coordinates. I'll let them know about you right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11111111111">
		<text>I got it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11111111111121">

		<text>So, how is it going?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_211">

		<text>Nimble has been saved.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_51">
		<text>What can you tell me, stalker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_511">
		<text>What can I tell you. There were bandits at the car park, so we did some cleaning up. That's about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_5111">
		<text>You aren't the bragging kind, are you! Look, since you've dealt with these thugs, I can't just let you go like that...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_dinamit_to_volk_start_0">
		<text>You look so serious. Are you worried about something?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_dinamit_to_volk_start_1">
		<text>I have a small problem... Hmm... Not so long ago someone came to me and placed an order. For a box of dynamite. I wanted to refuse, but I couldn't. Well, in general, it doesn't matter why. The dynamite is hidden in a locomotive which was derailed - there is also radiation there. By the way, at this point, there's no "barbed wire" along the embankment. The task is simple - you only need to find the box and bring it to me. You don't need to do anything else. So, how about it? And... If something suddenly happens to me, take it to the Army Warehouses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_dinamit_to_volk_start_20">
		<text>Deal. I'll try to find the dynamite.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Listen, no, I'm not ready for such a case yet.</text>

		<text>Well, I'm waiting for the dynamite then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_dinamit_to_volk_start_210">
		<text>That's a pity. Oh, well, I'll have to try to find someone else. If you change your mind - the offer still stands.</text>

	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_11">
		<text>Thanks, brother! You did a great service! I don't even know how to thank you...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_111">
		<text>Listen, I need that flash drive you were taking to the trader. Do you have it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_1111">
		<text>Yeah, I got it... Those morons can't even do a proper search. Well, what the heck, take it! After all, you saved my life. It was well hidden, but these thugs can't frisk for shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_11111">
		<text>Thanks. Where did you keep it anyway? Who knows, might come in handy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_111111">
		<text>I didn't keep it down there so don't worry. I've worked for a trader for a long time so I can store information safely. By the way I told the thugs a nice little story about a cache full of artifacts and they ordered one guy to go there. The cache exists, but it's only got one artifact. I can give you its coordinates if you want.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_21">
		<text>Have a safe trip, stalker!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_311">
		<text>Sure, thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_3111">
		<text>But don't forget: there're lots of wild animals there. Besides, the gangster they sent is armed with more than a scoop and a shovel, so be careful. Thanks, man.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_31111">
		<text>And thank you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_311111">
		<text>Sure, no problem. Good luck!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_done_blockpost_box_0">
		<text>Mission complete. Here's the box from the army outpost.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_done_blockpost_box_2">
		<text>Good! You were a great help. But, of course a "thank you" won't buy you a piece of bread. Here's twenty... wait, fifteen thousand and we're square! By the way, the soldiers will certainly notice it missing, so things are going to heat up. You better get going, and the faster, the better.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_0">
		<text>Got any special missions for me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_1">
		<text>Nope, nothing at the moment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_12">
		<text>What special missions? You haven't even finished with the last one yet!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_5">
		<text>Well, here's the deal... A box containing the reports made by an expedition that went deep North into the Zone has been taken to the army outpost. By day, it's guarded as if it was filled with pure plutonium, but for some reason at night, they only leave two guards.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_51">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_511">
		<text>Sneak into the outpost quietly and "recover" the box. Do that and I'll pay you anything...within reason. Will you do it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_5111">
		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_51111">
		<text>I'll get the cash ready - you haven't let me down once. Just one other thing... keep it low profile. If the military gets pissed off we're all in for a lot of trouble.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_52">
		<text>No, I'll find another way to commit suicide.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_521">
		<text>C'mon man, it's not as bad as it sounds. A bunch of drunk recruits green as grass with a single NCO...Well, OK, but I was really counting on you, Marked One...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6">
		<text>Listen, Marked One... I've done some thinking, and here's what I'd like to offer... Generally speaking, what you really need is to find Strelok. Right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61">
		<text>Let's assume I do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611">
		<text>Anyway, here's the thing about Strelok. There's a stalker that goes by this name. They say he's found a path to the northern reaches of the Zone. And that is a virgin area, a real goldmine for artifacts... Yeah... Anyway, I can help you find him... However... As you can imagine, it won't be a free ride. You'll have to work it off... But in the long run we will both benefit: You're going to waste that Strelok fellow and find out what's happened to you... And I'll find... well, I mean... I'll get my share of our mutual profit, he-he... So what do you say? Deal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111">
		<text>Go on</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111">
		<text>Alright, listen... You mean business, I can see that... And I... I mean, we need guys like you. We're doing sort of an investigation with some other traders. We want to open up the path to the North, to the centre of the Zone. And near the centre someone or something is trying to hamper our progress... How the heck this Strelok managed to sneak through, I don't know... You see, there's this one area where your brain starts boiling. An eerie place... Anyway, to cut a long story short - a couple of guys have been spying on them grunts for me, not far from here. Apparently, the ones at the Agroprom Research Institute, have dug up something. Something major. I'm positive it has something to do with the centre of the Zone. Anyway, whatever they've dug up, it's secured somewhere on the third floor of the Institute. And we really need this stuff. You see what I mean?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611111">
		<text>Yes I understand. What if they've found something heavy? What then?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111111">
		<text>From what I heard... It's apparently a small, white case. Well, Marked One, because stealing it from under the noses of the SBU Special Forces will be very difficult, you'll get paid a lot. They are - tough warriors. You need to be very careful. Maybe you can somehow slip in at night. Can you handle it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111111">
		<text>I can try. What do I do next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611111111">
		<text>Once you have the briefcase, don't bring it here. Take it straight to Barkeep. He runs the stalker bar, the 100 Rads, I'll upload the coordinates and all the data you need to your PDA. Clear?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111111111">
		<text>Well, I'll download the necessary coordinates and information to your PDA. I'll explain it to you, after you leave the Agroprom and arrive at the Garbage, turn right and then go north a couple of kilometres until you reach a checkpoint, then go west. Artifacts sprout in the Garbage like mushrooms after the rain but the place is full of radiation, so I advise you to buy antirads or vodka from me. You don't want to light up like a Christmas tree ... he-he. That's a joke! By the way, I advise you to take a companion - your chances would be better. However, that's up to you. Well good luck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6999">
		<text>Thanks. I hope I don't regret this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_2">
		<text>We've planned a small deal with the military: we give them ten artifacts, and in return - we get a batch of new weapons which are unaccounted for. As usual, they were sent by mistake: they pretended they were never received, he-he. You need to deliver a bag of artifacts to the military under the bridge and return with the box of weapons. You'll need to use the Zaporozhets we have in camp to bring back the crate of weapons from the bridge. It will be easier for you, you won't damage your back and have to be nursed back to health...\nI hope you'll be able to do it. Understood?</text>

		<text>Yes, everything is clear.</text>

		<text>So, you paid the X18 a visit? Got the documents?</text>

		<text>Yeah. Here they are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_19111">
		<text>Well, well... I see... Now that's interesting, very interesting! If I told anyone they wouldn't believe me! Hmm... Yeah... Oh! Would you just look at that! I didn't expect this... it's pretty bad, eh... Well, here take these back and give them to the Barkeep. Oh, and I owe you for your efforts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_199">
		<text>Wait. Here, take this pistol and ammo. You won't last two seconds in the Zone without a weapon! By the way, when you were brought here, you had a knife. I took it off you just in case your head wasn't quite working. You look OK though, so here it is.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_52">

	<string id="deal_with_mils_fail_1_text">
		<text>Well, Marked One? You were asked to fetch a box and instead you were out doing god knows what! The simplest task - any rookie could have done it with his eyes closed, but you failed! What, do you only know how to shoot bandits, huh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deal_with_mils_fail_2_text">

	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5432">

	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_7712">
		<text>Yes, here it, take it... Fuck... I was lucky I didn't get torn to pieces!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_7714">
		<text>Yes, here it is, take it... By the way, Sidorovich, saw a helicopter near there, it seemed it was attacking someone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_77121">
		<text>Well, Marked One, you've performed another task. Another couple of small favours - and were even.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_77122">
		<text>Hmm, a helicopter you say? Attacking? Listen, Marked One, return here until it has left and then have a look and see who it was attacking. Only don't poke your nose too close, the pilot can't tell from that height, if you're friend or enemy. If you have binoculars, watch from a distance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_6666">
		<text>Well don't just stand there, it will fly away while you're hanging around! Run, grab your binoculars and watch!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_7715">
		<text>Not yet, I'm startled by the military chopper. It seems they attacked someone.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_132453">
		<text>Marked One! Why did you come here, I sent you to rescue the wounded! Hurry, they're out there bleeding to death, if any are still alive!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_1324536">
		<text>I am on my way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_0">
		<text>I need answers to a few questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_1">
		<text>Ask away but I don't know everything. I sit here all day while life goes on outside, in the Zone. I can tell you about the Zone in general and a little about the nearby areas where I've been myself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_100">
		<text>Tell me about the Zone in general.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_101">
		<text>Ask away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_2">
		<text>What does the army do in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_21">
		<text>They guard and protect, what else? No one really knows whether they're guarding the Zone or protecting the rest of the world from it. Sometimes they send whole expeditions here to look for something... But I'll tell you something: they don't respect the Zone and the Zone doesn't like them either, that's why they return home in body bags very often. What else is there? Well, they look down at everyone and act like gods or something. They have no respect for stalker rules and won't ever help you even if you're dying right in front of them. They'll gladly shoot you themselves though, and they don't get reprimanded for that... I've got a few contacts among them... you know, people always need vodka and... umm, ammunition, right? Don't annoy them - they'll whack you for nothing..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3">
		<text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_31">
		<text>The Zone... You see, it's not just a circle a few kilometres in diameter with a nuclear power plant in the centre. It's something bizarre. Really bizarre. I doubt anyone in the world could give you a straight answer. I feel the Zone isn't even part of this world. It's a different, detached world, weird and dangerous... and attractive, too. And you know why? Because with a little luck anyone can get rich quick. And the closer you come to the centre of the Zone, the higher you will climb up the money ladder</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_311">
		<text>What's so dangerous about this "different world"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3111">
		<text>Hmm... Not a whole lot, except you can croak any second and not know what hit you. A dumb soldier's bullet is the least of your problems, although they've pulled in a lot of military here. Getting shot is basically the most painless kind of death in the Zone. Anomalies, now that's something for you... To die in an anomaly is a terrible thing indeed. Even mutants try to keep away from them. By the way, mutants, these "children of the Zone", are another kind of trouble, so don't go anywhere unarmed. And anyway, to learn about the other dangers, just ask other stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_312">
		<text>How does one get rich around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3121">
		<text>Gee, man, what do you think? You don't remember? Artifacts, that's the most important thing here. All sorts of weird toys that come from the Zone are worth a fortune in the Big Land. Artifacts are more precious than gold, diamonds or pure plutonium. Why? Because no jewellery in the world can give you the supernatural powers that these artifacts possess. Just imagine: you can hang a little gadget on your belt that makes bullets swerve by and never hit you! What else? Well, you can find bits and pieces even right here. For the most valuable pieces though, you'll have to get closer to the centre.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_313">
		<text>Does anyone know what's happening in the centre of the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3131">
		<text>It's a different tale every time you hear it. It's a bunch of fairy tales... except I don't believe all that otherworldly nonsense. The one thing I do believe is that the centre of the Zone contains a lot of valuable artifacts. Only I haven't met anyone who went there and managed to come back alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_4">
		<text>Do you know what happened to me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_41">
		<text>What kind of question is that? You see, that's some shady business... They found you in a "death truck", that's a... a kind of corpse carrier, right? These trucks come in from the centre of the Zone once in a while, loaded with bodies. No one really knows where they are heading. So, one of them crashed into something and you were found nearby. This is the most amazing thing of all. We've found broken-down corpse carriers before, but no one ever came out of them alive. I'm sorry, bro, that's all I can help you with. The rest you'll have to figure out for yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_5">
		<text>Who is Strelok?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_51">
		<text>Yeah, I've heard of a stalker by that name. Rumours is he's one of the few who went to the centre of the Zone and made it back. Still, we got so many of these legendary stories about stalker heroes that I can't really guarantee anything. At any rate, I've never dealt with him personally. It seems he has his own trading channels. Anyhow, just ask the folks here in the Zone and you'll be sure to learn a lot more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_6">
		<text>Who is this stalker, Ghost?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_61">
		<text>Heh, that's another local legend. We haven't had any news from him in a long while. I suppose he perished somewhere deep in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_99">
		<text>What's going on in this neighbourhood?</text>
	</string>

		<text>Look, now I've saved you, at least tell me, what's your real name, and where are you from?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tutorial_wounded_talk_3">
		<text>I thank you. I'll say that there are times when you just want to forget. So for you, I am just Tolik. That's all. Sometimes when people come here their real names are not known, only a nickname is used. And some stalkers use forged id's and use someone else's name. I suppose that you have a nickname. Sometimes stalkers forget their real names. And some, when leaving the Zone to go to the mainland and back use fake names. No one cares what our real names are anyway. I digress, to answer your question I am from the glorious city of Khabarovsk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tutorial_wounded_talk_4">
		<text>I understood. I'm not a fool. Tell me... what equipment do I need.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tutorial_wounded_talk_5">
		<text>Well, this is no problem. First of all, an automatic assault weapon is necessary in the Zone. Personally, I prefer the AK, but Sidorovich sells NATO weapons as well. I myself, haven't used one, but dudes like Wolf speak highly of them. Then you need a handgun to shoot small animals, like tushkanos or blind dogs. When you come across them - you'll see what I mean. Next, depending on the situation, you need a shotgun or sniper rifle. Sidorovich always has shotguns! I've been wanting to buy a sawn-off for a long time. Occasionally, he'll have a sniper rifle. He also sells grenades and body armour. When anybody, like Wolf, goes deep into the Zone, they always wear good body armour. If you haven't got good body armour - you can't consider yourself a stalker. If you work for me - I'll get you stuff on the cheap.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tutorial_wounded_talk_6">
		<text>I don't want to work for anybody.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tutorial_wounded_talk_7">
		<text>Well then, let me give you some advice. Almost free, but not useless. What's the most valuable thing in the Zone? That's right - information. Sometimes it's of more benefit than a gun or a gas mask. And most importantly, it's easier to use. One press of a button - and the information is instantly there. Therefore, most stalkers keep information of their caches, in their PDA. If you need help for example, just press a button... You'll know everything that has happened in the Zone - even if Wolf had a hangover in the morning. Send an S.O.S. message and everyone will come running, hoping to get your cache location. If the stalker has died, he no longer needs the stash whose information is still in his PDA. You see, your PDA also acts as a decoder. Look, you can earn yourself a good loot this way.</text>

	<string id="horror_time_story_2">
		<text>No one really knows. Some say that the phantoms - are a product of our imagination. It is known that the phantoms pursue only specific stalkers, and don't touch others. Scientists in Yantar say that the ghosts are born only if there are living stalkers nearby.</text>

	<string id="horror_time_story_3">
		<text>This is what we call the psi-emission. It often happens after a normal emission. It is so named because at this time something specifically starts to put pressure on the psyche. All sorts of bad thoughts and hallucinations start to come to our brothers. Phantoms appear, which can burn out the brain. They say that our thoughts somehow contribute to the appearance of these phantoms. During this time the less you think the less there is risk of phantoms. We can also escape them by drinking vodka.

		<text>Who is he?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yuriy_after_reward_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>A stalker named Chatterbox. He was supposed to be here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yuriy_after_reward_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Chatterbox, yes, he was here. Why are you looking for him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yuriy_after_reward_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>He came to you for a map, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yuriy_after_reward_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Well, if you must know, then listen up. Yes, he was here. And, apparently, it was he who led the bandits to the sawmill, but it wasn't his fault. Before the attack, Chatterbox left and I think some of the bandits followed him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yuriy_after_reward_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Where was he going?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yuriy_after_reward_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>To the west. To the Hunter's place, to lie low for a while. The Hunter lives there in an abandoned hut.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yuriy_after_reward_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Clearly, it's necessary to visit him.</text>

		<text>You're the Black Stalker, if I'm not mistaken?</text>

		<text>Nice to meet you, I'm a stalker called Marked One... Great weather today, isn't it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_pos1_phrase_4">
		<text>Simply magnificent! However you didn't come here to discuss the benefits of the local weather.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_pos1_phrase_5">
		<text>Yes, I must confess. The fact is that I would really like to get the notorious artifact called "Light".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_pos1_phrase_6">
		<text>Ah, so that's it... I see you know a lot about the rare artifact! I would be pleased to take you to the grave of the unfortunate who had it before his death.</text>

		<text>And you ask for nothing in return?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_pos1_phrase_8">

	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_pos1_phrase_9">
		<text>Is his name Chestnut?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_pos1_phrase_10">
		<text>Oh, I see that the rumours of my adventures with him are already quite widespread, that's good! But remember, my friend: in the long journey ahead, you must protect this precious animal at all costs. As you have already noticed, I am totally blind, but at the same time, I can see you. How, you ask? Well, because I share a common sight with Chestnut; I see what he sees. Accordingly, if something happens to my dear dog, the consequences for you personally will be very bad. What do you think?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_pos1_phrase_11">
		<text>Fair enough. It's a deal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_pos1_phrase_12">
		<text>Great. Follow my dog and look after us both! Oh, and one more thing: if the worst were to happen, then you better kill me, or you will die yourself! You have been warned! Then you will seek me in this very place.</text>

		<text>Okay.</text>

		<text>Why don't you protect him?</text>

		<text>Is this the place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_ochyag_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Behold: before us is the grave where I had buried one of his friends. I know why you needed a "light" artifact - you want to get into the Death-zone to get a part of map that shows the location of the Klondike of artifacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_ochyag_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>How do you know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_ochyag_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Well, I am the Black Stalker. Now I will go into the abnormal hearth and fetch the artifact, but I will not give it to you yet because it's impregnated with too much anomalous energy and it can be dangerous for a mere human. As soon as I get the "light", we will go immediately to Zakharych and there I'll tell you something very useful.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dik_goto_ochyag_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>Okay.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Do you have it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Yes, I have the artifact. Now we'll go to the Hunter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Let's go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_1">
		<text>Well, can I have it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_2">
		<text>Yes, meanwhile I will stay here, Zakharych knows me. The truth is, he's a little afraid. Take the artifact, it seems to have cooled down. Now you can safely enter the "Death Zone," but I advise you not to stay there too long.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>Thank you, Black Stalker!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_4">
		<text>Just call me Dick.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_5">
		<text>Well, Dick. So, what did you want to tell me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_6">
		<text>It concerns the purpose of your quest... Have you thought about what happens if you find the Klondike?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_7">
		<text>I'm not yet sure whether it really exists, maybe it's just a legend. Tell me, is the Klondike a reality?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_8">
		<text>Follow your intuition stalker, because you can trust it. All I can tell you about the Klondike, it's just that at the end of your journey you'll have to wage a deadly battle with one of the creatures of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_9">
		<text>And who will win?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_af_light_dialog2_phrase_10">
		<text>This is something I don't know. Good luck to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_1">
		<text>What on earth are you looking for? Did you lose something?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_2">
		<text>I haven't lost anything. I'm just looking. It's been almost a week! These spirits, they keep hovering around me...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_3">
		<text>I don't understand! I'll ask again: are you crazy?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_4">
		<text>Man, just don't think I'm crazy, or as drunk as a skunk! I'm not! In this house there is some kind of hell happening. I settled here recently, Wolf told me I could. He said it was the only free house in the village... Yeah, I can see why nobody wanted to live here, the place is terrible!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_5">
		<text>What is wrong then?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_6">
		<text>Something invisible comes through here at night. The first night I slept here I heard it: loud stomping and moans, and sometimes I could even make out some words. They stomp through the house, moaning and then they begin to quietly sneak up on me; they are barely audible except for the creaking floorboards. If you lay down and don't move, you can hear the breathing become harder... It starts to choke you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_7">
		<text>Wow! What is it? A Controller perhaps, or what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_8">
		<text>No this is not exactly a Controller. This is something much worse! I'm afraid that I can't stay here any longer, and must get the hell out of here...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_9">
		<text>But you didn't answer my question: What are you looking for?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_10">
		<text>Ah, yes! I forgot. I began asking the lads around here. Well, one told me a story. True or not, I don't know, but it seems that before the Chernobyl accident, the owner of this house was brutally murdered. They say blood was found everywhere, even in the yard, but the body was never found. Or rather, they found part of it; the murderer dismembered the corpse and hid the pieces in different places: in the house, in the yard and even the immediate vicinity. It seems that the spirit of the dead man cannot rest. Of course, I didn't believe it at first, but when this mess started in the night, I thought: "Perhaps it's the truth?". So I searched the house... Imagine this! I found a strange bone under one of the floor boards. I showed it to the doctor, and he said it was human. I don't know what to think right now!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_11">
		<text>Let me look, maybe I can find something else.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_1_phrase_12">
		<text>It doesn't make sense... </text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_2_phrase_1">
		<text>Listen, I've found some bones...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_2_phrase_2">
		<text>Where?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_2_phrase_3">
		<text>In various places in the yard. A skull, wrist, shin...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="muzikant_quest_dialog_2_phrase_4">

	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_reward_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>You're asking me? After all, it's your house.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_reward_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Look, I don't think it matters now. I'll bury the remains you found; here at the edge of the village is a small cemetery. It seems that I'll sleep much calmer now. Here, take this as a thank you.</text>

		<text>Well, then, let me explain the situation: we're not sitting here on our bum for the fun of it. We have a contract to capture an army officer, who's serving here in the Zone. According to the agreement, he must be taken alive and very quickly as he is very urgently needed by some people. We know that he will be driving past soon in a van, with three military bodyguards. It's necessary to stop the van, eliminate the guards and grab the officer alive and unharmed if possible. All clear?</text>

	<string id="dar_merk_lider_start_dialog_phrase_17">
		<text>How do you plan to stop him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_merk_lider_start_dialog_phrase_18">
		<text>My guys have laid dynamite on the road. When the van with the colonel is near us, you will have to detonate the charge so that explosion doesn't damage the car, but compels the driver to pull up by the roadside, and then we will give you smoke cover. I'll give you a signal when to detonate the dynamite. Remember, we need the Colonel alive!</text>

	<string id="dar_merk_lider_start_dialog_phrase_19">
		<text>Everything is clear, we can proceed.</text>

	<string id="dar_merk_lider_start_dialog_phrase_20">
		<text>Well, here's the detonator. The charge is beside the rusty cars on the road. I would advise you to keep a low profile and to detonate it from right here, in this barn. You can watch the road through the window. The van should appear at any moment, from the east.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="bratstvo_lider_start_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>This is an old German bunker the saboteurs used during the war. I will tell you more later if you help us. Time is short. I want the doctor to go with you to our brother's aid, and Tokarev, who is our gunsmith, will act as your guard. Take them back with you and cover them.

		<text>That goes without saying.</text>

	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>What are you doing, wandering around here? You're interfering with our operation!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>What operation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>The "Duty" group's operation to apprehend offenders.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>What did they do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>Those two are members of a criminal organization which is engaged in theft of artifacts and the looting of stalkers. They ransack  caches, steal the loot, and then sell it. Is that clear?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>What are you going to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Arrest them. Look, whatever your name is... well, never mind. Tell those buttheads that they are caught, to lay down their arms and surrender. They have five minutes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>I'll tell them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_gaz_dolg_lider_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Listen mate, you and your "Duty" group can piss off!. You fucking cops are crazy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_1">
		<text>They are from Duty and they have come for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_2">
		<text>Oh no, we've had it! We need to do something... We must get out of this trap somehow!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_3">
		<text>Listen, this Duty guy says that you and your friends in the bunker are stealing artifacts. What the hell's going on here? I demand an explanation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_4">
		<text>So be it, circumstances require me to tell you the truth. Look, we and the rest who you saw in the bunker are members of a secret brotherhood called "Cleaners". What we are engaged in, is not theft at all, we clear the Zone of artifacts and, respectively, we save the outside world.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_5">
		<text>In my opinion, this is why Duty got involved.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_6">
		<text>They destroy the consequences, and we are fighting the causes. It is because of those people who came here for these creations that there is so much evil in the Zone. All members of our brotherhood have a personal account to settle with the Zone. For example, I lost my wife to the Zone, Tokarev - a brother, and our leader Arkady - a son... We don't steal artifacts, you must understand. We collect them by all suitable means and destroy them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_7">
		<text>I'm sorry, Did I hear you correctly? You said "destroy"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_8">
		<text>Quite so. This is our revenge on the Zone and our method of controlling the cause of the anger generated by greed for artifacts and money.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_9">
		<text>At this pace, can you achieve significant results? You appear to be a small group.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_10">
		<text>Yes, we have a total of nine, but we have agents in almost all parts of the Zone and among all the factions, even in the "Monolith". They try to intercept large consignments of artifacts and to redirect them to the Darkscape, also reconnoitre places of group caches and warehouses, also block deliveries from dealers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_11">
		<text>So that's why "Duty" is so mad at you. They don't want you to touch the artifacts so they can pass them on to the scientists.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_12">
		<text>I am a scientist myself and I can tell you that to do research requires a much smaller number of artifacts than the management of "Duty" gets every month from his quads. Marked One, we don't want to harm anyone, understand. We destroy evil in its tracks. Help us! Don't let these executioners capture us, no one should know the location of the bunker, otherwise our brotherhood will end!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_13">
		<text>What can we do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_14">
		<text>I need to hit the road.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_15">
		<text>I propose to use the power of the artifact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_16">
		<text>What do you mean?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_17">
		<text>Our brother Jeka came around a few minutes ago and told me that you managed to defuse some anomalous trap that was here before. Is that true?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_18">
		<text>Actually, yes. It was something like a spatial anomaly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_19">
		<text>This phenomenon is known to us. It is generated by the 'Pendulum' artifact. If you intend to keep it for a long period of time, it shouldn't come in contact with a living body. Because it made him feel uncomfortable, our brother kept it in the safe forgetting the code - all this you know. But the point is this: This unique artifact has a very interesting feature - it can teleport objects over short distances. For this purpose it is necessary to combine it with an artifact generating electrical energy. When the artifact discharges, the "Pendulum" will absorb the energy and will make a spatial jump, dragging its carrier with it. Understand what I'm saying?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_20">
		<text>I got it. But there is one problem. During the destruction of the spatial trap, the artifact shattered into pieces.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_21">
		<text>Don't be surprised, this is its feature. It very often breaks up into some fragments but after a while, having received an impulse, it grows back together and becomes whole. How many pieces of the "Pendulum" do you have?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_22">
		<text>I had four, but I gave the largest piece to your leader.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_23">
		<text>This is destiny! The circumstances could not be better. See: we can use the pieces of the "Pendulum" to transfer to the bunker because when they absorb the electrical impulse, smaller pieces will be attracted to the larger one and each of them will entrain its owner. But there's a problem...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_24">
		<text>Yes. There're four of us, but we only have three pieces.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_25">
		<text>Something to offer? I have run out ideas.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_26">
		<text>You, Jeka and Tokarev teleport to the bunker, and somehow I will find a way out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_27">
		<text>It's necessary to leave the injured here, he's a goner anyway.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_28">
		<text>To hell with Tokarev, we need to save our skins.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_29">
		<text>Listen, that's very generous of you! If you haven't change your mind, then give me the pieces of the "Pendulum" and we'll leave right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_30">
		<text>It's a pity... He's our best agent. Well, nothing can be done, we'll have to leave him here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_31">
		<text>You're despicable... It would have been more desirable if he lived, now Duty will capture and execute him. Let me help Jeka and you prepare the pieces.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_32">
		<text>Until we meet again. Here are the pieces. Good luck, Cleaners!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_33">
		<text>Okay, here are the pieces of the artifact, give me your "Sparkler"...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vrach_agent_dialog_3_phrase_34">
		<text>No time for pity, bring on the impulse, here are the pieces...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="orujeinik_zapravka_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>What will we do? No one wants to be captured by Duty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="orujeinik_zapravka_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Hell, it's not funny.</text>
	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="orujeinik_zapravka_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>I'd love to, but the forces are not equal... All I took with me was a this weapon. It will frighten boars away, but against machine guns, it's a weak argument. Listen, speak with Korneev, he may come up with something.</text>

		<text>Yesterday, we explored the neighbourhood and found something interesting. We want to examine this thing better and we need someone who will cover us. If you help us with this sortie, then if we find anything valuable, we'll share it with you. Okay?</text>

		<text>Are we there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother1_freezer_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>You could say that. See this fridge? There is something hidden in it and I want to see what it is. Yesterday, my brother and I couldn't open it, but today I brought some pliers. Perhaps there is something of value inside...</text>

	<string id="zona_brother1_freezer_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Hmm, interesting. Well, search it and I'll cover you.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_start_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Ha-ha. Yesterday I was behind these suckers watching them trying to open the cache, but they couldn't. Then I decided to play trick and put a grenade in the fridge. So, well, you know, it's there, and it blew the guys face off! Ha-ha-ha!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_start_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Do you even know what you've done? You've killed a newcomer.</text>

		<text>You're bothering me!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_start_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Well-well, he won't make that mistake again. I advise you not to mess with me. Do you know why? If you denounce me, you will have to deal with Kulgavy. He will send his gladiators and they will massacre all in the village, together with Wolf and Stalin, it's like duck soup for them because all of them are masters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_start_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>Who is Kulgavy?</text>
	</string>

		<text>Hmm...</text>

	<string id="freezer_bandos_start_dialog_phrase_15">

		<text>Alright, hold on.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog3_phrase_1">
		<text>Okay, he's dealt with.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog3_phrase_2">
		<text>Funny, dude, funny, funny! You did a great job with him. You'd have to put the carcasses in the fridge, nobody will find them there for a long time... Hey, would you like to work for my boss? He needs people now.</text>

	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog3_phrase_3">
		<text>Who is he?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog3_phrase_4">
		<text>Kulgavy. He recently had a falling out with the other leaders, so he took his most loyal guys, formed his own band, and is now laying low. He sits quietly, but he keeps his ears open! I was sent here to get info for him and what not.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog3_phrase_5">
		<text>How can I find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog3_phrase_6">

	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog3_phrase_7">
		<text>Got it, thanks for the info.</text>
	</string>
	
	
	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog4_phrase_1">
		<text>Okay, fuck him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog4_phrase_2">
		<text>I fucking told you to keep it quiet and use a knife! If stalkers find their corpses, they'll ask me a lot of questions and I'm going to have to fuck off. Okay, I'll shove these suckers into the fridge so that nobody will find them. But you should come see the godfather in Darkscape.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_dialog4_phrase_3">
		<text>I'll check it out.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_freezer_dialog_phrase_2">

	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_freezer_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Calm down, tears of sorrow won't help. It's better to decide what to do next.</text>

	<string id="zona_brother2_freezer_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>I don't know if I can keep from killing this motherfucker... It's hard to think about it. The Zone, is a bastard! Why did we come here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_freezer_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>Come on, be a man. Now you have to be careful. I would put a bullet in this freak's head, but this may affect other people. We'll wait for a more convenient opportunity.</text>

	<string id="zona_brother2_freezer_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Yes I know... I will learn to survive and who to trust.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_freezer_dialog_phrase_8">

	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_2_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Yes, I kicked his ass, and he took off and ran.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_2_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Why did you kill him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freezer_bandos_2_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>He pushed me around.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_dialog2_phrase_1">
		<text>How are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_dialog2_phrase_2">
		<text>I've been better...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>Did he hurt you badly?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_dialog2_phrase_4">
		<text>I don't know, I can't feel my hands or face... My bones seem to be intact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_dialog2_phrase_5">
		<text>The swelling will pass, you'll live. I see you really can't stand up for yourself. You've got a weapon!</text>

	<string id="zona_brother2_dialog2_phrase_6">
		<text>I could not kill this monster... his friends would have killed me... Now they will take revenge.</text>

		<text>I think he lied through his "teeth".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_dialog2_phrase_8">
		<text>Listen, I can't thank you enough. I don't have anything other than this old gun and a can of food, but I don't think it would be much help to you. Here's what: when my late brother and I went to the ATP, we saw a tunnel entrance at the end of some railroad tracks. Inside the tunnel, something shone and shimmered, it was similar to an artifact. It was at night and we weren't able to inspect the tunnel because there were a lot of dogs about and we had bad weapons. Look there, and if it's something really valuable, then it is yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zona_brother2_dialog2_phrase_9">
		<text>I'll go and look.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Hi brother. I have a message from Borov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>From whom?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Don't you know Borov? He's the big boss.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>I know he's the big boss, but why the hell would he send us a message all of a sudden? We're on Friar's payroll, he is in charge of us. He's Borov's right-hand man.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>I know, I know... Friar is busy, so he sent me. Anyway, I've got a message.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Give it to me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Here you go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>So... What the hell... Who the hell is this from, I don't understand?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>What's the problem?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>Don't you dare tell me that Borov wrote it. What the hell is this crap: "wankers", "I'll poke your eye's out", "I'll get nasty"? What the hell is with all the mistakes? Borov is well educated, proud of it, and his men respect him for it...! Listen, this belongs in the trash, doesn't it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>Why are you making such a big deal out of this? If you're trying to act like a big shot Borov will shoot you in the head himself!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>Okay, I'll tell it like it is...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_13">
		<text>Come on, but make it quick. By the way: who are you? Our messages are always delivered by Nosey, and now you decide to come here in here and bring me this note??</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_14">
		<text>I'm actually a stalker, not a bandit. Don't be in a hurry to shoot: I come in peace! Why spill blood unnecessarily? It is better to negotiate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_15">
		<text>Indeed, why not? Let's talk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_16">
		<text>Look: you release the prisoner, and I go to the stalkers who are sitting ready to ambush you (there are ten of them) and convince them not to attack you. How's that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_17">
		<text>Ten you say? Wow ... And where are they hiding?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_18">
		<text>In the bushes, fifty metres to the south of the here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_19">
		<text>Look, you're right... Let's do it, I value my boys, you care about yours. Besides, the guys are kind of outnumbered. Now I'll give the signal to let the prisoner go, and you go and talk to yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_20">
		<text>Great, I knew you were the reasonable man!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_21">
		<text>A reasonable man? Um... Hey, I almost forgot. What's that thing sticking out of your pocket?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_22">
		<text>Where?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_23">
		<text>Friar wrote a transfer order for the prisoner, and asked me to deliver it on his behalf.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_24">
		<text>Why is that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_25">
		<text>Recently he scored big time, so he's decided to lay low for a while because he doesn't want to attract attention.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_26">
		<text>Probably lost at cards again, playing with the brothers. Ha-ha, now he won't be yapping about his good luck. Okay, forget what I said, just give me the note and take your fucking loser and get the hell out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_cheat_dialog_phrase_27">
		<text>All right, I got it.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog1_phrase_9">
		<text>... broke it? That's sad.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog1_phrase_10">
		<text>Yeah. By the way, do you want to earn some money? If you help me and take it to get repaired, I'll tell you a secret.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog1_phrase_11">
		<text>What secret? Something about the design of the locking mechanism? It would be cheaper to read a book about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog1_phrase_12">
		<text>No, something much more interesting: I'll tell you about a very strange anomaly, which I found in a cave. One I have never seen before.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog1_phrase_13">
		<text>Tempting... Okay, I agree. Where do you want me to take your weapon?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog1_phrase_14">
		<text>I'm busy at the moment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog1_phrase_15">
		<text>Look: when you get to the Bar, go to the building where the Arena is located. To the right of the entrance, sitting alone in a small room, you'll find a stalker, who definitely will be drunk. If he's asleep, then wake him up and hand him the gun. Tell him if he doesn't fix it, he'll get no more from me. Got it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog1_phrase_16">
		<text>Understood.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_1">
		<text>Greetings, mate. I here from Yuri the Digger, on account of his custom shooter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_2">
		<text>Mm-m... What-oh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_3">
		<text>I'm from the Digger. He brought you his gun for repairs but you fucked it up. It won't even shoot anymore, so fix it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_4">
		<text>Who...what Digger? What gun? Where in general am I? What day is it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_5">
		<text>You should drink less! You're at the Bar. Get your head together and correct this work on the digger's gun.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_6">
		<text>I'm not... hic... in good shape right now. I need another drink, otherwise I'll die. Pour me one, huh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_7">
		<text>Have a drink.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_8">
		<text>No "pouring"! Just fix the gun, I don't intend to wait until you sober up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_9">
		<text>Why are you people are so evil... You should be good guys... Okay, give me the gun.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog1_phrase_10">
		<text>Take it:</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog2_phrase_1">
		<text>How's it going?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog2_phrase_2">
		<text>It's done. Forgot to put a spring in the last time, everything will be fine now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>I'll take the weapon back to its owner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_1">
		<text>I found Bruise at the Bar and forced him to repair your machine gun.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_2">
		<text>Well done! Come on, let me look at my baby...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>Receive and pay:</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_4">
		<text>So, let me try it out... Hmm... Something is not right.. What is this nonsense? Strange.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_5">
		<text>What's the matter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_6">
		<text>Shoddy work, that's what. What did that butt-head fix? The breach - it looks like he took to it with a sledgehammer. The paint on the magazine is scratched and the trigger mechanism seems shattered. No, it's not a good job, it's garbage. I once saw how Freedom at the Military Warehouses repair weapons. I'll tell you what, it was a feast for your eyes. That person had imagination! This... won't do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_7">
		<text>What now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_8">
		<text>What do you mean? Naturally it needs to be repaired, immediately. I can't travel through the Zone with just a pistol! Take this trash and carry it back to Bruise. Tell him everything wasn't fine, okay?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog2_phrase_9">
		<text>I'll tell him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog3_phrase_1">
		<text>Come on, it's time to take responsibility for what you did.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog3_phrase_2">
		<text>Comrade Sergeant, I'm not guilty, I didn't do it!.. Oh, it's you again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog3_phrase_3">
		<text>Yuri has ordered that you finish the work. It's still fucked, even more than before perhaps. Here, fix it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog3_phrase_4">
		<text>I've had enough of you and Yuri. Okay, hand the gun here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog3_phrase_5">
		<text>Here you go, repair it so I don't have to come back again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog4_phrase_1">
		<text>Is it ready?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog4_phrase_2">
		<text>It's ready, you bastard! I forgot to tighten a couple of small screws the last time, that was the problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog4_phrase_3">
		<text>Well, great then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog3_phrase_1">
		<text>Bruise corrected his work, take your damn gun:</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog3_phrase_2">
		<text>Wait, wait! Let me take a look. Yeah ... Yeah ... Hmm. And what's this? How is it possible to make such gross blunders? This angers me!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog3_phrase_3">
		<text>It's not right, again?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog3_phrase_4">
		<text>Of course not! Look at the coating over the barrel: It's hopelessly scratched and starting to rust. And the nozzle on the gas tube is loose, and when I start shooting, I guess it will just fly off. Verdict: this weapon is unusable!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog3_phrase_5">
		<text>What can I advise you. Look for another repairman.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog3_phrase_6">
		<text>Uh-uh, no, Bruise will repair everything for me! He's done such good work for me at other times, besides, he promised. So take the gun back to him, you know what to do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog3_phrase_7">
		<text>Well, damn you, I'll take it back to your amateur gunsmith!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog5_phrase_1">
		<text>Hey, alcoholic! Get up, more work to do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog5_phrase_2">
		<text>I have the day off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog5_phrase_3">
		<text>No, you have to finish what you started.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog5_phrase_4">
		<text>What, the gun broke down again?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog5_phrase_5">
		<text>It never worked. Fix this piece of rubbish, it's your last chance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog5_phrase_6">
		<text>There is no rest for the weary. Give me that piece of iron.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog5_phrase_7">
		<text>Take it and remember that my patience, too, has limits.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog6_phrase_1">
		<text>Everything fixed?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog6_phrase_2">
		<text>Yes. I went through everything, I checked and tightened all the screws and lubricated it. The receiver works like a charm, the trigger is the same. You must understand, I would have checked it out before, but you cannot shoot here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog6_phrase_3">
		<text>Any spare parts accidentally left over?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog6_phrase_4">
		<text>That offends me!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog6_phrase_5">
		<text>Then it's time to drag this "masterpiece" back to its owner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_1">
		<text>Well, now your gun is finally ready. Take it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_2">
		<text>Ready, you say? He-he... No, I've been around too long, I'm not easily fooled. Let me look at it through a master's eyes... So... \n~ a long silence ~</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_3">
		<text>Well?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_4">
		<text>Marked One, I don't understand...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_5">
		<text>What?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_6">
		<text>Are you and Bruise, trying to scam me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_7">
		<text>Don't say that...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_8">
		<text>Well, this thing's not working! What else is new?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_9">
		<text>I cannot stand another trip to the Bar humping this instrument of contention.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_10">
		<text>Marked One, you want to know the secret of the unknown anomaly? It's worth it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog4_phrase_11">
		<text>I would like to, so I'll take your gun this last time!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog7_phrase_1">
		<text>It's me again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog7_phrase_2">
		<text>Again? How many times do I have to see you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog7_phrase_3">
		<text>Bruise, if you fix this damn gun correctly both of us will be better off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog7_phrase_4">
		<text>I'll fix it again only to prevent him from accidentally shooting himself. Give it to me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog7_phrase_5">
		<text>Here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog8_phrase_1">
		<text>Is that it? I don't even want to hear about what you forgot to do last time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog8_phrase_2">
		<text>Okay... I won't. Take the damn gun, I'm tired of looking at it...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog8_phrase_3">
		<text>Listen... Maybe we should take it to Barkeep or to Sidorovich. We could both chip in a little for repairs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog8_phrase_4">
		<text>It's not that simple: They both hesitated for a long time to do it, so I was the only one who agreed to repair it. You know, this model is trash, it was never issued. All the parts come from different models, some of which should have been bulldozed into the ground, plus a bunch of unnecessary bells and whistles. I'm not sure if it even ever worked.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog8_phrase_5">
		<text>There is no escape, you have to drag it back.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_1">
		<text>Here's your gun. Bruise said that it's now in 100 percent working order.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_2">
		<text>I trust no one, I'll check!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_3">
		<text>Don't you believe me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_4">
		<text>You, I believe, but Bruise, no. Let me see, so... nope! What the fuck is that rattling around in there? I wouldn't dare shoot this thing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_5">
		<text>You've got to be kidding me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_6">
		<text>I'm starting to wonder, is this his blunder or yours? Or perhaps both?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_7">
		<text>Fuck off, I'm doing all the legwork here so save your bitching for someone else.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_8">
		<text>How is it that you don't care? When I got this thing it barely worked. As far as I could tell, this gun was never combat ready: I'm telling you this for the last time, the receiver was hanging and the recoil spring was missing. Yes, apparently, I'm talking to deaf ears. Marked One, it's time to get your feet moving again!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_9">
		<text>Why are you telling me this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_10">
		<text>I say that this indecency should be corrected. You know what to do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_11">
		<text>I know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_12">
		<text>Look, why don't you...?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_13">
		<text>Ah well? Okay. I hope you won't be surprised when the traders won't buy artifacts from you? The scientists are too far away to go there... I can take care of this because I have known Sidorovich, Barkeep and Miser for a long time. This is your last chance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_14">
		<text>Don't try to pull the wool over my eyes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_weapon_dialog5_phrase_15">
		<text>Sorry, I got excited... I'll take the gun to Bruise.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_1">
		<text>Guess what I brought you again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_2">
		<text>What now? It's not funny any more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_3">
		<text>I know. We need to do something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_4">
		<text>I tell you what: just tell the digger that you lost the gun, and that's that..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_5">
		<text>It's not an option. He cherishes this piece of junk and would not forgive me. I wanted to refuse this bad job, but he threatened he would stain my reputation with the traders.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_6">
		<text>He can... We must be more cunning. Let's get him a new gun, and then we can throw out this piece of shit. I will try to make it look similar, and you tell him it has undergone a serious renovation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_7">
		<text>Damn it, come on. I've had enough of this Yuri the Digger. This gun is special to him, he'll pick the substitute.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_8">
		<text>Bullshit, I'll do it so he won't be able to tell the difference.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_9">
		<text>You can get this gun?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_10">
		<text>There's one available...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_11">
		<text>How will you get it? You spend everything on vodka, but I can see it in your face that you have a plan.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_12">
		<text>A Duty friend has one, he obtained it a long time ago. No problem, I'll figure something out. As a last resort, I'll party with him and get him so drunk, he'll give it to me and not remember anything in the morning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog9_phrase_13">
		<text>Well look. This is our last chance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog10_phrase_1">
		<text>How's it going?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog10_phrase_2">
		<text>Everything is okay. The nerd won't be able to tell the new gun from the old one, even under a microscope.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sinyak_weapon_dialog10_phrase_3">
		<text>I hope so, otherwise my reputation as an artifact hunter will be tarnished.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Hello, Strelok. I see you managed to cheat the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>It was you and I who were cheated, Doctor. How are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Oh... I decided to retire.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Done with being a stalker? But why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>Because Strelok, there are more important things in life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>I won't disagree. So, are you leaving the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>No. Now my calling is to help those who are in need.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>Who will you help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>I will treat people and mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>Mutants? Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>Well, they are living beings as well... Strelok, I'll explain everything later, alright?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="swamp_doc_start_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>Okay.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_1">
		<text>Perhaps, you need some help with your work?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_2">
		<text>Yes. I need help with treating.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_3">
		<text>Sounds good.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_4">
		<text>Just be careful, because we'll treat bloodsucker.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_5">
		<text>With bullets, I hope?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_6">
		<text>Think before you say, Strelok! Listen to what I have to say. There's this unique bloodsucker, I've been watching him from the roof of this house. So, he is unwell for some reason. It is necessary to examine the beast, but you understand it won't hurt to take safety precautions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_7">
		<text>Do you want to catch him alive?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_8">
		<text>Exactly. It's necessary to shoot it with a tranquilliser dart from my special pistol, then drag it back here. Only it should be done quickly, before it can wake up. The tranquillising effect will last for about three minutes, but that should be enough time. Well, can I count on you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_9">
		<text>Let's try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_10">
		<text>I'll pass.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_11">
		<text>Well then, remember: you're not allowed to approach the mutant closer than 15 metres, otherwise it will smell you, even through the reeds. Be careful, use the optical sight and choose a comfortable position. If you scare away the mutant, you will then have to chase it around the Marsh, and I don't have any more special arrows. And don't try to shoot the bloodsucker with firearms! I won't forgive you if you do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog1_phrase_12">
		<text>Thank you for the warning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog2_phrase_1">
		<text>Take your "sufferer"!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog2_phrase_2">
		<text>Well, thank you, Strelok, now he's safe!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>When you begin the treatment it could wake up and attack.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog2_phrase_4">
		<text>Do you think I had not foreseen such a possibility? Don't worry, I have my own methods of influence on mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog2_phrase_5">
		<text>Well, you're a real Doctor Doolittle!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog2_phrase_6">
		<text>Well, aren't you the joker! Okay, it was a dangerous assignment, so accept this humble present from me:</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog2_phrase_7">
		<text>Thank you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog2_phrase_8">
		<text>No, I do not take gifts from you, you saved my life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog3_phrase_1">
		<text>As it turned out, I had to euthanise your bloodsucker.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog3_phrase_2">
		<text>Right, because you had to go, like a bull at a gate! I would be scared, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog3_phrase_3">
		<text>It's not my fault that he was so sensitive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog3_phrase_4">
		<text>Therefore Strelok, it's necessary to be more cunning. You should have climbed up a tree and shot him with the dart from there, as he dashed past.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_krovosos_quest_dialog3_phrase_5">
		<text>Have you surrendered to the Zone?  Every day, stalkers are shooting mutants, struggling for survival in the Zone; why did you suddenly decide to treat them?</text>

		<text>The answer is not so simple. I'll tell you later why I made this decision, but for now, rest.</text>

	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_1">
		<text>What's up, Doctor?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_2">
		<text>Trouble, Strelok. There's an old pseudo-dog who lives here in the neighbourhood, that's unwell. It's necessary to treat it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_3">
		<text>Like your little bloodsucker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_4">
		<text>What do you mean "little"? What's that got to do with it? I ask for your help.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_5">
		<text>Do I need to tranquillise it and drag it here too?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_6">
		<text>As soon as possible.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_7">

	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_8">
		<text>No.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_9">
		<text>Well, then listen. You already have my special pistol, here's some more tranquilliser darts. Though the pseudo-dog is sick, it can still pick up your scent, therefore don't get any closer to it than 20 metres, because you will frighten it away! When you tranquillise him, quickly drag him back, before he wakes up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog1_phrase_10">
		<text>Understood.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog2_phrase_1">
		<text>I brought the pseudo-dog. It seems it's still breathing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog2_phrase_2">
		<text>Good for you, Strelok! I'll start treatment, and you deserve a good reward. Take this in all sincerity:</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>It'd be an honour!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog2_phrase_4">
		<text>No, Doctor. I won't take anything from you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog2_phrase_5">
		<text>Don't be stubborn! I appreciate your attitude, but you risked your life. Take it, while I'm still offering.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog2_phrase_6">
		<text>You talked me into it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog2_phrase_7">
		<text>Still no thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog3_phrase_1">
		<text>There's a problem... basically, I accidentally killed the pseudo-dog.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog3_phrase_2">
		<text>Oh, Strelok! Well, so be it. It's a pity about Pirate - he served me faithfully for long ago.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog3_phrase_3">
		<text>It was your pet pseudo-dog?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog3_phrase_4">
		<text>Not just a pet, he was... more my friend. Something attacked him in the marsh and infected him with distemper, he ran away from me, crazed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="unik_pseudo_quest_dialog3_phrase_5">
		<text>It's a pity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>You called me, Doctor, so here I am.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Well done. Let me tell you a story.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>I've heard your stories before.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Of course, tell me. But I need to drink something first. I am dehydrated from running to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>I get the hint! What do you prefer: local or imported?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Ah, a trick question. As far as I know you have imported vodka that is better than the local product.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>I have a lot of things, but I don't advise you to find fault with the local product. Not all of it is of poor quality.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>I'm persuaded. Let's have the local drop.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>I shudder at the thought.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_9_1">
		<text>Yuck!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>... So, Strelok. It's like this: while I was here at the Marsh I met a friend of mine. He told me a curious thing. You know where it is - the Dead City?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>Near the Army Warehouses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>Correct. So he said that he saw something strange there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_13">
		<text>Amazing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_14">
		<text>In fact, he said that he met his former friend there, who died a year ago.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_15">
		<text>Hallucinations are rampant in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_16">
		<text>Of course. But I believed him, even though he didn't understand it. What is interesting is this: his acquaintance asked him to give me a message, 'that soon something bad will happen to me'. What exactly, he did not say.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_17">
		<text>He told you that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_18">
		<text>Yes. And that's why I'm telling you this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_19">
		<text>Who is the stalker, who told you this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_20">
		<text>A Loner, who had been in the Zone for two years. I treated him a few times for swamp fever, and of course examined him thoroughly. His mind was sharp and he wasn't a drug addict. You see, Strelok, I'm not a superstitious person, but all around us in the Zone new miracles happen every day, so you never know... Of course, I don't believe in messengers from the underworld, do you understand?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_21">
		<text>Do you take this message seriously?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_22">
		<text>There are many reasons to do so. Firstly, stalkers spread many rumours, one more absurd than the next, but some are true. Secondly, is that I'm not touched by mutants. And thirdly, of course, is my collection of artifacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_23">
		<text>Collection of artifacts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_24">
		<text>Yes, the best and most complete in the Zone, and most likely, around the world... I can't tell you their value. Among them are several unique specimens.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_25">
		<text>Wow, Doctor! It's dangerous to possess such goods, especially when your alone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_26">
		<text>Well, I already have some protection thanks to your efforts. The pseudo-dog and the bloodsucker will help, if need be. But after all, I'm not at home all the time, sometimes I go hiking on different affairs, often I call in at the Bar... Don't think I'm afraid, things are just different. I still have a lot to do in the Zone and I'm afraid that I don't have much time, so I can't stop. I beg you, deal with this case. Find out who this Stalker was, how he died, and why he appeared to my friend?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_27">
		<text>I'll try. but first, I have a couple of questions for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_28">
		<text>Don't fill your head with this silly nonsense, Doctor. No offence, I won't do it, I promise, no one will hurt you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_29">
		<text>Of course, I'm listening.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_30">
		<text>To begin with: did you know that the deceased, who warned you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_31">
		<text>Yes, I once helped him. It was no big deal: he was bitten by blind dogs and infected with rabies, his friends gave him aspirin at the start of the illness, but I took advantage of the opportunity to treat him, I happened to be at the Bar at the time. I saved his life, he was pleased and thanked me afterwards. He offered me money but I didn't take it. A year later I was told that someone at the Garbage had shot him. Whether it was bandits, or someone else, I don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_32">
		<text>And the stalker, who allegedly saw him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_33">
		<text>I already told you that I treated him for swamp fever which he picked up here. They call him Smoke, he's a Loner, who's been in the Zone for two years. I know nothing more about him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_34">
		<text>Where can I find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_35">
		<text>He often appears here in the Marsh. He stays at the farm.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_36">
		<text>What does he do here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_37">
		<text>Most likely looking for artifacts, what else. There, near the convoy of abandoned machinery you can sometimes find rare things.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_38">
		<text>And the last question:  when is the last time he was there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_39">
		<text>Why don't you ask him? Try it, why not. Only here's the deal: don't tell him that I told you where to find him. Understood?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_40">
		<text>Why the secrecy?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_41">
		<text>If this Smoke or someone else, has started something bad against me, they will say nothing to my envoy, that's you, and even worse, they will lie nineteen to the dozen. Tell him this: you were at the Doctor's, he was unwell and asked you to assist him in finding the ingredients for the medicine he needs to cook. Ask him where you can get the different chemicals, I'll draw up a list for the sake of appearances. Then try to find out something about the case.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_42">
		<text>Okay.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_43">
		<text>I'll watch the farm from the tower through binoculars. As soon as I notice someone there, I will send you the message at once. And you, please stay in the Marsh for a while. If you get bored waiting, you can perform a simple task for me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_44">
		<text>I never refuse a task.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_45">
		<text>Good. I found myself an inflatable catamaran, but it's broken; it has no propeller. I don't want to order such an exotic thing from behind the perimeter, there are more important things. But you can try to get something similar to the propeller here. To the east of my house is a downed helicopter. If you tried to separate part of the screw from it, maybe, I could somehow adapt it for my needs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_46">
		<text>I'll have a go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_47">
		<text>Not today, Doctor. I am tired.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_48">
		<text>Then take a scientific suit and more antirads, because the place is contaminated:</text>
	</string>
	<string id="karlito_quest_dialog_phrase_49">
		<text>Okay, then rest. And I will keep watch from the tower.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="quest_not_work_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Hi, who are you, and what are you doing here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="quest_not_work_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>I'm waiting to do some quest, but for now, I'm stuck here as a reminder.</text>

	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>You called?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Yes. In short, look here: you're a normal guy, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>I'm normal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>If you are normal, you have to subdue simpletons. Let's do it together, join me and my brothers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>No one owes anyone anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Fuck it, let's do business. You want a lot of dough?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Are you inviting me to join you to rob a bank?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>No, this is much easier. It's necessary to rub out a simpleton.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Cool, surely killing this simpleton, will pay a mountain of dough.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>Yes or no?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>Yes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>No.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_13">
		<text>Then listen up: soon this simpleton who needs to be terminated, will pass through the Garbage on his way to the Cordon. This is not just an ordinary simpleton, but Barkeep's "mule", loaded to his ears with a sizeable loot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_14">
		<text>What's in it for me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_15">
		<text>You'll get a quarter of what he carries.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_16">
		<text>That isn't enough.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_17">
		<text>Plus the respect of all our lads. If nothing else, Borov himself will offer you protection.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_18">
		<text>I understand that there are still some details to work out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_lider_work1_dialog_phrase_19">
		<text>Yes. First, the "mule" will be guarded. Who and how many, fuck knows, but not a lot, because Barkeep will want to keep this campaign as low key as he can. Secondly, the "mule" will be equipped with a personal GPS beacon so Barkeep can keep track of his location. When the load reaches its destination, the "mule" is to send a signal to him that everything went well. If he doesn't then the Barkeep will enlist help from the Duty law enforcers and they will begin to scour the Cordon. We don't want this, so the work will need to be discreet: Once you have the loot, drag it here immediately.</text>

		<text>Where did it come from? It's probably not garbage.</text>

	<string id="hunter_about_ufo_dialog1_phrase_6">
		<text>There was an incident a month ago. A star flew over the Darkscape, It flew from east to west, it was very low, even the trees bent and then, it crashed and shattered somewhere near the sawmill, throwing out purple sparks. That's the story, believe it or not.</text>

		<text>No, if I was younger, I would have remembered, but I can't now. Look, humour an old man. Help me to assemble a moonshine still, then my soul will become cheerful, maybe I will help me remember.</text>

		<text>A moonshine still? Where can I get one for you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_about_ufo_dialog1_phrase_16">
		<text>Let me think about it. Many of us oldies loved moonshine. It turns out that moonshine stills were set up where people lived, that is, near dwellings. Where were the most people in the Zone before the accident? That's right, in the cities. It's necessary to look for it in Pripyat, or in that town that is now called the "Dead City", I don't remember what it was named as earlier. Pripyat is too far away, so don't go there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_about_ufo_dialog1_phrase_17">
		<text>The moonshine stills would not only be in the Dead City, but in villages, and on farms surrounding it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_about_ufo_dialog1_phrase_18">
		<text>Could be there. But in the cities they were many set up, not just for local use, but also for sale. So, I would be easier looking for the device in the city.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_about_ufo_dialog1_phrase_19">
		<text>But where? The town is small, but it would be like searching for a needle in a haystack.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_about_ufo_dialog1_phrase_20">
		<text>I'll give you a hint. Search the basements and the attics of buildings. Moonshining was illegal so the stills were hidden in out-of-the-way places.</text>

	<string id="hunter_about_ufo_dialog1_phrase_21">
		<text>If I find one, I'll bring it.</text>

		<text>What do you usually do when this happens?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="horror_time_20">
		<text>Well... with mutants. I shoot them and they just disappear. They don't fall... they don't die, they simply just disappear... they dissolve into the background...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="horror_time_21">
		<text>Sometimes this happens. Either after an emission, or near a psi-zone. It's nothing, you'll get used to it. This is not the worst thing here.</text>

		<text>No harm will come to you. You have a headache now brother. At such times, I try to think less and stop paying attention to what's happening around you.</text>

	<string id="horror_time_24">
		<text>And why "think less"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="horror_time_25">
		<text>First, because your head simply hurts, and secondly, they say that phantoms generate your thoughts. So, try to think less.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="horror_time_26">
		<text>And why not pay attention?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="horror_time_27">
		<text>It's necessary to stop paying attention in order to survive. Otherwise, the phantoms will reformat your brain so that you will become a zombie, and then you will die.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="horror_time_28">
		<text>So it's... you know, that after an emission this crap happens. Listen, can you spare some vodka so we can survive this nightmare?</text>
