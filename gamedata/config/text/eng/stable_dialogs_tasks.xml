Marked One, can you try to find it? There's a reward, of course, not great, but the case is also a piece of cake. It's a pity because the guitar is in good condition, not broken at all. It has sentimental value. Ask stalkers in camp, may be someone knows something.</text>

		<text>We've got planned a small deal with a friendly representative of the local military forces, so to speak ... In short, we give him a dozen artifacts, and for them we get - a batch of new weapons, unrecorded. The military command mistakenly sent them, and they as usual - said nothing, he he. It's necessary to deliver a container of artifacts to the military under the bridge and collect the weapons in exchange. The box will be heavy of course, but you won't have to carry it back. Use the Zaporozhets that we have here in the camp to bring back the box of weapons from the bridge, Okay? It will be easier on you and I won't have to nurse you back to health after you've injured your back. So that's the deal, try to do it professionally... Well, will you do it?</text>

		<text>That's good. So now go to Wolf - he'll give you the container.

I repeat, we have an arrangement that the messenger will come in a Zaporozhets. By the way, the rattletrap needs refuelling.\nWhat, did you expect that everything would be laid out on a silver platter? Well, good luck!\n Almost forgot!

Now, to come back, he has to go through the checkpoint again and he said he can't cope with that. Marked One, I suggest you send the soldiers at the checkpoint to hell and save the poor soul. Naturally I don't expect you to assault the checkpoint all on your own. I will organize a special squad of 10 fighters, together you will quickly overpower the soldiers. Well, what do you say?</text>

	<string id="bar_kvest_qest_on_elevator_kill_sniper_4">
		<text>Some guy at the Cordon tried to kill me with it, but after the first shot it exploded in his hands. The breach bolt shattered and blew off his head, so I couldn't ask him who he was working for. The rifle was lying beside the corpse. In your eyes I can see - you know something.</text>

	<string id="bar_kvest_qest_on_elevator_kill_sniper_5">
		<text>Yes, you're right - I do know something. Let me go on. I don't think anyone is hunting for you, Marked One. The stalker who shot at you - was a sniper, whom I hired to eliminate one man. It looks like he confused you with his real target.\nDamn it, now such turmoil will begin, you can't imagine...I'll be brief Marked One, and show you all my cards: It was necessary to have a stalker eliminated. It was ordered by serious people, and for a great deal of money. Apparently, this stalker seriously crossed their path. You understand, the customer didn't tell me all the details. I couldn't refuse him - it wouldn't have gone well for me. But at the same time, no one would have known that I had agreed. The contractor also had to go after the client.\nA local craftsman had made me some TNT cartridge. You know about these? A bullet fired from it flies in the same way as of conventional powder cartridge. But the explosion of TNT is so strong that it breaks the gun and kills the shooter. Everything would have turned out, but the sniper confused the target, the scumbag ...</text>

At the same time I will share with you - a "surprise" as compensation. In such affairs one doesn't put a figure therefore as a last resort I employ a hitman. Your task is to remove this killer. But pay attention! It must be done only if he eliminates his target. That way no one will be the wiser.

	</string>
	<string id="bar_kvest_qest_on_elevator_kill_sniper_9">
		<text>Yes it is. The stalker, as I understand it, found a passage to the Dead City. Fuck knows what deal he made to find out, but some people don't want him to get there. The passage, as I understand it, is through an old littered tunnel, and this dude planned to drag dynamite there so as to clear the blockage. The customer somehow found out about it and contacted me. I'm actually concerned myself, that he does not get there - that place is terrible, Marked One, there is nothing good to be found there... A passage through to there for us would be of no use, there is only crap to be found there... There you have it. Go now to the Cordon and remember: don't kill the assassin before he removes his target. So, I've forgotten nothing. And yes, I'm going to mark his position on your map.</text>

		<text>The parasite is curious, and...don't you have anything better to do? Well, fuck it - we're tired of hanging around and not being able to leave.

		<text>Oh, thank you ... Heh, I actually just wanted to have some fun with you ... Well, okay, quid pro quo. Our helicopter crews have complained that here, in this small sector, strong radio interference occurs. Well, we were sent here to find out why. We searched back and forth... in short, we found a strange artifact. It emits strong radiation, and when you get near it you start to feel strange - feeling sick and dizzy. Here we stand, protecting it from the hands of others - suddenly it has become valuable, heh. We could make some money then... Okay, now you can go. If we see you here again, you'll have problems.</text>

		<text>Well, actually, we wouldn't refuse your help... But that's one thing I don't understand: Why would you suddenly want to help us, knowing that you could catch a decent dose of radiation? Heh, by any chance, did you bump your head recently?</text>

		<text>Back to business... I decided to hit a jackpot. Well, why not. Go on, get out there and grab it for me, then I'll give you something useful for it.

	<string id="esc_kvest_help_teterev_start_1">
		<text>Well ... Fanatic is mad at me ... He gave me a task - to bring him a "Night Star" artifact urgently ... I failed. Now, because of me, he has problems and I cannot go back to camp. Fanatic is ferocious, he said: "I won't let you return until you bring the "Night Star", I'm very disappointed in you - and the customer is angry"... Just get one from somewhere, I don't care where. \n
		But I had thought it all out: I knew where to find the artifact, I waited a moment, then went to pick it up. I had gone thirty metres and saw how it glowed, I climbed through the bushes... And then suddenly a stalker hopped out of nowhere - grabbed my artifact and stuffed it into a container. At the same time: BANG! He caught a bullet. I looked - it was bandits. The reptiles waited until he pulled it out of the anomaly, then shot him. They hadn't noticed me hiding in the bushes, and after they shot him, I immediately took cover. They searched the poor guy, took the artifact away and went towards the Cordon. Well, I quietly followed them - hoping I might get the opportunity to steal their artifact container. But no - they went to the Darkscape at settled the gas station... I was afraid to get close to them, and catch a bullet. That's it. I didn't get the artifact from them, so I can't go back to camp. So I sit here alone...</text>

		<text>You can? Listen, I'll be very grateful if you help. Go, try to get the artifact from the bandits.

He came across something unusual at Yantar and came looking for me, so we could go and reconnoiter together. I had just returned from a raid, and wanted to rest.

	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_start_9">
		<text>I'm racking my brain on how to get there quietly...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_start_10">
		<text>Quietly? In a crowd of zombies and snorks? Well, well, I think you should think further. But in this case. I won't do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_start_11">
		<text>Quietly you say ... I have an idea! I'll go to Sakharov, he may be able to suggest something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_know_zombied_0">
		<text>Professor, is there a possibility to fool the zombies and mutants, so they don't attack people? I'm sure you have been asked this question before...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_know_zombied_1">
		<text>If you're wondering, this is a key point in ensuring the safety of our laboratory. Alas, detailed consideration has shown that: Mutants only attack objects whose aura lacks certain information. All the creatures have a "Learning Zone", so to speak. So the only way to avoid an attack - is to change the aura of the object. In a word, become a zombie. \nIncidentally, in the process of studying the impact of psi-emissions on living organisms, we have developed a serum in our laboratory that, when ingested by a human, creates an experimental zombie. It solved the problem of a shortage of biological material - you know, the mere trapping of mutants did not meet the needs of laboratory to the full. This serum increases the body's sensitivity to a range of psycho-waves, inducing a state of "light" zombification of the subject. It is noteworthy that the effect of the serum is only temporary and does not result in death of the animal. However, human trials have not yet been done, of course. Thus, the answer to your question: Theoretically it's possible, but it can have quite dangerous consequences for humans. Why are you interested?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_know_zombied_2">
		<text>Another stalker and I need to become zombies, it's very important. Help, please, Professor.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_know_zombied_3">
		<text>A strange request... I should dissuade you from this idea... But I'm afraid if I don't help you, then you are likely to succumb to radiation and become a zombie. This wouldn't end well... Okay, I will prepare the desired serum for you. But for that, I need a sample of water from the lake at Yantar: I've run out of suitable samples, and this eliminates the need for replenishment - our research has moved to a new level.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_know_zombied_4">
		<text>What kind of water is it? And where can I get it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_know_zombied_5">
		<text>This water contains unusual neurotoxins formed during prolonged exposure to radiation. In any case, you shouldn't drink it, as it causes reactions that increase the susceptibility to the influence of psi. Not to mention the inevitable content of various impurities, including poisons. Bring it to me, and I will prepare a serum for you, the use of which will cause you to go into state similar to that of a zombie, but only temporarily. You can get the water from a small swamp not far from here, near the crashed helicopter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_know_zombied_6">
		<text>I'll get you the water.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_know_zombied_7">
		<text>Wait, don't rush. I'll give you a flask for the water. Be careful, that swamp is not safe.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_give_kilba_to_sahar_0">
		<text>I got the water. Here you go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_give_kilba_to_sahar_1">
		<text>So, let me have a look ... Yes, that's what I need, the water is perfect for the preparation of the serum.\nNow I'll mix all the necessary ingredients and the serum will be ready.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_give_kilba_to_sahar_2">
		<text>[Wait]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_give_kilba_to_sahar_3">
		<text>The serum is ready. Once you take the drug, you may become ill. It's not dangerous and will change within a minute. When the serum wears off, zombies will attack. Be careful not to miss the moment of the serum's expiration.</text>
	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_chuk_2">
		<text>Sakharov produced a serum which will turn us into temporary zombies. While we're in this state, zombies and snorks will leave us alone.</text>

	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_chuk_3">
		<text>Dumb idea, but damn it, let's try. There doesn't seem to be any other way. You have the first drink and I'll have the remainder.</text>

	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_5">
		<text>Found? Really ... Let me guess, Sample "O-21"?</text>

		<text>How do you know about that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_7">
		<text>I was part of those awful experiments. During the experiment, our minds were merged, completely losing our individual will... And believe me, I was not happy with all this. We experienced strange pressure on our minds, sometime later. Almost all the test subjects became thoroughly addicted with the obsession - to create an ideal world, becoming Gods in it. It seemed the only way they could achieve this - was to give up their identities, and merge into a single super being. This idea to us was intentionally introduced to us, it seems tried to make our brains something like a very powerful computer, having turned us into an impersonal appendage. It was terrifying, I struggled and resisted. But what could I change? I had barely enough strength to struggle to cling on to the fleeting remnants of myself... I resisted as well as I could - but my head went to pieces at the same time: I have seen such horrific hallucinations that I've screamed in terror and wanted to die. My mind saw fragments of the future - I saw the Zone, long before it appeared. But the heartless scientists, who only  saw us as lab rats, decided that my psyche was not strong enough to  withstand the experiment, transferred me here - to the X-18.\n
		So I came here, and kept my mind. I don't know what happened to the rest. And yet, this group of scientists had created a sample of "O-21" that you found...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_8">
		<text>An atrocity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_9">
		<text>Oh, do not say ... But "O-21" is a beautiful trap, which has some kind of donor relationship with the C-Consciousness. With it you think clearer and have better ideas, but it can drive you crazy, infecting your brain with notions about the "ideal world." But the longer you interact with it, the worse you will be... I sometimes call myself, "Seeing Stone" because of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_10">
		<text>What should we do with it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_11">
		<text>Well, we should - destroy it. It's too dangerous. But that is not so simple. The sample material is only halfway complete, and trying to destroy it, won't work. However, there is a place where it can be destroyed. I have no idea where it is, and certainly can't imagine what it's called. But I can clearly see its outlines: somewhere in the rocky terrain is an anomaly, like a small pool. It seems there was an evacuation attempt nearby, but apparently it was unsuccessful ... I see a half-destroyed bus, abandoned vehicles and construction equipment. This anomaly - was one of the first in the area and is very strong. It is able to consume "O-21", destroying it without a trace. Although, you know, you can make a choice. Some have sold the soul of this sample.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_12">
		<text>I'll find this place and destroy the artifact.</text>

		<text>Well, good luck, Stalker!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_2_0">
		<text>Well, it's over. I destroyed Sample "O-21".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_kvest_help_to_chuk_talk_with_dstalker_2_1">
		<text>Destroyed? Really. This is great news. I didn't even believe that you would succeed. Lucky you.\nBy the way, I forgot to tell you. Those records that you found in Professor Thompson's  cache are very important to the scientists. I advise you to give these records to Sakharov. Maybe the scientists can decipher some very important data from the records. And you can get a good reward.</text>

		<text>Thank you. I believed that there were good people in this world. So, we, that is, Bulrush and I, were returning from a raid. The amount of loot was - absurd. Earlier I had a bad premonition... Then it happened. We were on our way to Sidorovich, we only had a little way to go when Bulrush shot me in the back. I lost consciousness, and he thought I was done for, so he took the loot and disappeared. I pulled myself together, sent a SOS signal SOS, and to my relief, you arrived. Listen, find this reptile and take my share away from him. No need to kill him, just take my share and send it to my wife. My daughter is sick. She needs surgery. Because of Bulrush, this would be my last raid. The money is just enough. I beg you, for God's sake, send the money to my wife. Here's my PDA, it has the address where you can send money ... Do it!</text>

	</string>
	<string id="esckvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_sidor_0">
		<text>You said you had a small job?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esckvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_sidor_1">
		<text>Yes it's a breeze. A lone stalker wound up here... a very suspicious person, with a no less suspicious appearance. We saw him at the farm in the Dark: sitting Valley, frowning as if contemplating something, and went to the factory three timed that day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esckvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_sidor_2">
		<text>So, what's so strange about that? Can't a stalker go to the factory?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esckvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_sidor_3">
		<text>It's not that. There, at the factory in the Dark Valley, we spotted some movement - maybe mercenaries or monolith had settled there. We couldn't get a better look at what he was up to - he moved across enemy territory, then disappeared. But that's not all. The same stalker was seen repeatedly under the bridge at the military checkpoint. There he talked with Kuznetsov about something. \n... In general, dark doings, Marked One. I don't like it. After the military raid on the bandit's base in the Dark Valley everything settled down, and the military became more active there - Kuznetsov has already sent soldiers to the base three times that was unscheduled. Here and there groups of soldiers intersect. Helicopters are circling like they're looking for something.</text>

	<string id="esckvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_sidor_4">

	</string>
	<string id="esckvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_sidor_5">
		<text>No, not at all! I told you it was easy - Just follow the stalker as he goes back and forth. See what he does at the factory. If the soldiers under the bridge are not angry with you, then try to talk with Kuznetsov, he can tell you interesting things. Tell me the results. The size of your reward depends on the results.

	<string id="esc_kvest_help_to_scoryi_about_sitnik_2">

	<string id="esc_kvest_help_to_scoryi_about_sitnik_4">
		<text>His partner, that Bulrush mortally wounded, the poor man stayed alive long enough to tell me. He was saving the money for his daughter's operation. His last raid was indeed his last. I promised to fulfil his last request - to get his share of the money from Bulrush, and send it to his widow.</text>

	<string id="esc_kvest_help_to_scoryi_about_sitnik_5">

	</string>
	<string id="esc_kvest_help_to_scoryi_about_sitnik_kuzn_11">
		<text>And how. There's a loner who comes here, begging rounds. Many come begging. Here I am, at the same time, a soldier with a requisition for more ammo. The main warehouse keeps asking us why we require so many supplies.</text>

	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_0">
		<text>Come, let's talk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_1">
		<text>Where's my gear? Who put me here? What's going on?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_2">
		<text>Don't panic. I'll tell you everything. So, in case you haven't noticed, there are a lot of strange things happening in the district. There is a reason for this - the military are planning a special major operation. Frankly, I don't know what they intend to bring into the Zone, but it has the "Monolith" running scared. In general, they see this as a direct threat to the Zone and to their own very existence. Therefore the "Monolith" are planning a counter operation whose main objective – is not to allow the device to pass into the Zone. The mercenaries pursue a somewhat different cause - they don't care about the Zone, they just want to steal the device - apparently to fill somebody's order. Thus, the interests of two powerful groups are met, and, most importantly, they don't contradict, but complement each other.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_3">
		<text>Now I know, however. Let's deal with this. We'll have to think - what to do about it. Come on. How do you know all this? How did you get involved, and why did you go to military under the bridge?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_4">
		<text>I got involved in the most direct way. I was hired for a lot of money to play the role of "negotiator", so to speak. There is this one guy, with the military under the bridge. Alexander Ovechkin - he's in good standing with Kuznetsov. Whether monolith or mercenary, this clown couldn't tell them apart, but he managed to recruit them – I don't know how, but for a "mole", he's doing well. I had come for cartridges. Kuznetsov sent someone to the base and while I waited for the order, Ovechkin was supposedly talking peacefully with me on the sidelines. In fact, he gave me all the necessary information. Sometimes Kuznetsov sent Ovechkin to the base. That's when I got to know the latest facts "first hand." Getting cartridges was a needed distraction for him to get information. Well that, and to a lesser extent, to strengthen the combat potential of mercenary and monolith troops..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_5">
		<text>I had fun with you. Now for the big question. Why the hell are you telling me all this? What's the catch? I'm about to be executed, and you have decided to tell me the truth before this monumentous event?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_6">
		<text>No catch. Think of it like this – I woke up with a conscience. Yes, don't laugh. You see, once upon a time I defended people.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_7">
		<text>Where you a cop?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_8">
		<text>Sort of. I have not worked in my profession for many years, I turned a blind eye to all that was happening around me. But now - it's over. I don't do this anymore. There's too much turmoil now to ignore. After all, if the "Monolith" are frightened of that damn thing the military has dragged in the Zone,  it's possible to assume that it's some sort of weapon. And a powerful weapon at that. If this military weapon fell into the hands of the mercenaries or anyone else, it could cause a lot of problems. This cannot be allowed to happen.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_9">
		<text>Listen, do you really believe that ... How many of them? Twenty, thirty?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_10">
		<text>Thirty. A total of thirty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_11">
		<text>Well... Do you believe, that thirty people can cause enough damage to the entire military expedition? Surely the soldiers will have helicopter gun-ships and BTRs to protect them... And their number of personnel ... is not small.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_12">
		<text>If only it were so simple. The "Monolith"s are cunning pricks, they've dug up some psi-unit from an unknown underground laboratory. I don't know in what condition it was, or whether they had to fix it, but it works. And it works only on mutants. the "Monolith" say that all they need. Mutants have always been abundant in the Dark Valley and the Garbage. Install the unit in the right place, they can provoke a so-called "rutting season". Have you ever seen it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_13">
		<text>I heard of it, but never seen it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_14">
		<text>Well, I have. I can assure you, the "Monolith" will have a certain advantage. All that will remain of the expedition will be a few body parts. This is very dangerous shit, that the mercenaries have.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_15">
		<text>What do you suggest? Once you have freed me, you have a plan, I hope?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_16">
		<text>No, no plan as such. But there is a goal that must be achieved - we must disrupt the plans of the mercenaries and monolith.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_17">
		<text>Commendable. First. I need my gear returned. Secondly - it is necessary to warn the military. I doubt that the two of us can overcome thirty well-trained fighters alone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_18">
		<text>At the factory, they're not up to strength. There's just some top-brass and a dozen fighters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_19">
		<text>Whatever. All the same, it's an unnecessary risks. We need to find a simpler way. But it's necessary that military believe us. Any idea where we can get evidence that they are preparing an ambush?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_20">
		<text>The chief of the mercenaries has a laptop. Surely there is enough stored entertaining information. You'll find all your gear in Borov's box.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_21">
		<text>Clear. I need to get my belongings before we enter the factory. You distract the main mercenary, and I will try to grab the laptop from his desk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="val_kvest_help_to_scoryi_talk_with_orlov_22">
		<text>Move. There's a dead bandit up ahead, take his suit and then you can go for your things. Then we'll move to the factory. I will say that you are my assistant, because that amount of ammo is heavy to lug around by yourself.</text>

		<text>So, we're almost there. Follow me and stay close. I'll take you into the mercenaries main office, well, you know what to do - you pinch the laptop and then we get the hell out of there. Then we'll tell the military everything. Got it?</text>

	</string>
	<string id="esc_kvest_iscelenie_talk_with_ecolog_2_3">
		<text>The Professor is right. About a month ago two diggers, came to the laboratory and brought us a gas cylinder. There were biological hazard warning signs on it. The stalkers were confused. We purchased the gas cylinder, and I began to study its contents. As it turned out, there was a virus inside. It's called... I won't give you its long scientific name. For my own reference, I baptized it "boar flu", "avian fever", "bloodsuckers itch" - or something like that. The structure of the virus clearly indicates that its origin is artificial. To find a vaccine under normal circumstances, I think would take a decade, but fortunately, there is one in the Zone now. 
At about that time, I had studied a very curious and extremely rare plant: Ranunculus insolita. What do you think? Even a small amount of its juice is enough to completely destroy the cells of the virus! A "vaccine" for humans has already passed tests. A week after the diggers left the lab, a stalker showed up. He said that he breathed in some muck in one of the laboratories and had those same symptoms that you have listed. Blood tests showed that the number of units of the virus, read off the scale. Three injections killed the virus, and in a day the stalker was completely cured.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_kvest_iscelenie_talk_with_ecolog_2_4">
		<text>Do you have this plant juice?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_kvest_iscelenie_talk_with_ecolog_2_5">
		<text>Not anymore. It's quite impossible to keep - it's perishable. But I do know where to find it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_kvest_iscelenie_talk_with_ecolog_2_6">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_kvest_iscelenie_talk_with_ecolog_2_7">
		<text>If I understand correctly, it grows near water. The very first time I found it, was in the swamps near the Army Warehouses. There was some crazy sitting there and screaming all the time, he even tried to shoot me.\nBut that's irrelevant. Bring me three stalks, and I will make a vaccine. But remember, it will only help if it's less than three days since he caught the infection. After that, the process of destruction of the body is likely to be irreversible.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_kvest_iscelenie_talk_with_ecolog_2_8">
		<text>Wait, I'll be right back.</text>

		<text>The fact of the matter is that I didn't pick it up, it was given to me.</text>

		<text>How so?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_kvest_iscelenie_talk_with_sidor_5">
		<text>Some kind of stalker wearing a brown cloak came here, and said, well, he was delivering a gift someone had sent me, and puts a box on the counter. I asked, how much is this going to cost me? And he says: nothing at all. A man, who wishes to remain anonymous, presents you with a gift completely free, you have nothing to pay. I thanked him and he left. Well, out of interest I opened the cover of the box and something inside hissed, then the cellar filled with gas. I didn't have time to realise what was happening. I think he played me for a sucker. That evening I was laid up with fever and was shaking with an intolerable cough.</text>

		<text>In general, here's the story. A week ago, Duty clashed with the mercenaries. They usually like to remain neutral, but this time something happened. During the shoot-out, a detachment of Duty was defeated and the squad commander was taken prisoner. Duty then contacted the mercenaries and demanded the return of the captured commander. The mercenaries agreed, but only for a very large ransom. They had no choice, the commander was an experienced man and Duty couldn't afford to lose him - so an exchange was planned. You need to keep an eye on what's happening and, if things don't go according to plan - you never know what could happen - support Duty with cover fire.

The military are going to get him out of the Zone and send him to specialised interrogators, they are sure to find methods to squeeze out every drop of information from him.  All this is very bad, Marked One. If this information reaches the mainland, it will become a disaster for us. It won't be possible to go fishing for artifacts in the Zone for a long time. I'm afraid we have few choices - it's necessary to save the guy, and quickly. Or, if you really have no other choice - kill the guy.

		<text>Hello Stalker. Yeah... I don't know what to do... Ah, if it wasn't for my poor health and old bones, I would go to Pripyat - I want to find my daughter. And then there's the military! The are unhelpful - they won't give me a pass.</text>

	<string id="start_kvest_search_doch_of_starik_2">
		<text>And what happened to your daughter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="start_kvest_search_doch_of_starik_3_1">
		<text>I used to live in Pripyat with my only daughter, Tanya. She was 10 years old and in third grade at school. I worked in the turbine halls of the third and fourth units at Chernobyl. I'm a turbine specialist... All was well, and we lived happily. And then the accident happened at Chernobyl. I was  unlucky, I was on the night shift - and close to the fourth reactor. Our shift remained on site during the tests because our replacements hadn't arrived. Everything was going fine and all the tests were completed, except for the last one. At that moment, there were two powerful shock waves, the second was much stronger than the first one. Dust rose up around the control room, and then everything went quiet, well, at first, it was not clear what happened. I was probably only about thirty metres from the reactor. I ran into the room - the Block Control room is located between the turbine hall and the reactor room, and saw this: the lights were out, short circuit flashes were coming from the on-site feed pumps followed by steam and a strong burning smell.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="start_kvest_search_doch_of_starik_3_2">
		<text>Holy cow.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="start_kvest_search_doch_of_starik_3_3">
		<text>I ran to the fourth reactor control room, the room was a mess, Tregub, the shift supervisor, ran to manually open the valves of the reactor cooling system, deciding it was urgent to apply water to the reactor, so I tagged along, to help. We rushed out into the corridor, where the annex was located. We ran up the stairs. There were blue fumes hanging in the air, strange... we didn't pay much attention to it, because we didn't yet understood how serious this was... after inhaling these fumes , as we reached the 27th step, we could feel a strong metal taste in our mouths. But not below that. It happened suddenly. Tregub ran ahead, he knew this place like the back of his hand. There was a wooden door. He grabbed for it - apparently it was swollen - and wouldn't give! We wanted to enter, but couldn't - and it was impossible to stay there. We went back to try to get into the turbine hall. We opened the door and saw the hall was piled high with debris, and the roof was gone...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="start_kvest_search_doch_of_starik_3_4">
		<text>Yeah, that's a picture.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="start_kvest_search_doch_of_starik_3_5">
		<text>The Turbine Hall roof had collapsed - as if hit by something ... I could see the stars in the sky through the hole, under my feet were pieces of the roof, and black bitumen, so... so dusty. I thought - wow ... what's all this dust? Is this - bitumen coating dried up by the sun? It's not usually dusty. Or insulation so dry that it turned to dust? Only then I realized. It was graphite. From the reactor. Then I spun round - opened all the valves, then rushed outside to see what had happened, well because, from in here you couldn't tell. Outside, everything was covered with graphite. And over the fourth reactor, was a luminescence. It was bright blue. In general, I inhaled a very decent dose. Well, it became clear that everything was very bad. I called Tanya that afternoon, I told her to close all the windows of the house and not to leave for any reason. In the evening of that day I became ill, my mind was swimming and I was taken away by ambulance.</text>

		<text>You don't mess with radiation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="start_kvest_search_doch_of_starik_3_7">
		<text>Immediately the next day I was transferred with the others to the City Clinical Hospital №6 in Moscow, by then I almost couldn't see straight. It saved me as a result. While I was recovering, my daughter was home alone, and now, I cannot return home. I was in a coma for almost four days. I asked about her when I awoke, it was said the entire city was evacuated, but I never found my daughter after I recovered. I searched and rummaged all papers - she didn't get out of the city with the rest, she was never evacuated. She's probably frightened... And hiding, that's why she was never found. I've been looking for her since and I won't stop until I die. I came to the Zone to find her... or, at least, her remains. Or maybe she's still alive, and I will be lucky enough to see her again! It will remove a burden from the soul of an old man...</text>

		The preliminary measurements which are carried out by the investigation group, revealed a number of zones with raised (higher than average for this territory) background radiation levels. They have also explored and mapped 5 locations of abnormal activity,  and located 48 separate abnormal formations. Only 3 monster related incidences occurred during the operation suggesting there is low mutant activity in the area.
		We discovered that the entire length allows the smooth movement of wheeled and tracked vehicles and can be used to transfer our forces from Checkpoint №4 at Perimeter without involving aviation.
		At the moment, the protection of the area immediately adjacent to the passage area is entrusted to a squad commanded by Major Kuznetsov, located under the railway bridge.\n \nThe Commander of the 2nd Company\nS/isthmus Kahn V.I.</text>
