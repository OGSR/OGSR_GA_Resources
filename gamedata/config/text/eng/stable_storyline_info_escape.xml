		<text>April 26, 1986.\n\nToday dad didn't return from work in the morning. I woke up, and he wasn't at home. I'm not scared, I'm grown up and used to be home alone since mother left us. Perhaps dad picked another shift, sometimes it happens. I looked in the window: there was a smoke over the station where my dad works. Looks there was something broken, and he was busy repairing it. Well, at least I wouldn't go to school today. I heated up soup, eat some and went to play in the streets. Adults around looked frightened and often looked at dad's station. There're strange military men on the streets, all in rubber suits with some devices. Also there're those cars with water tanks, drive around, wetting roads.\n\nApril 27\n\nYesterday dad called from work and told me not to open the windows and not to go out of home. He said that they had an accident and he was delayed at work a little more. Oh, it seems like something happens on the street. I'm going to listen. \n\nThey said something about the temporary evacuation and "hostile environment". They said to go out from house with papers and items of first needs until 14-00. But I can't go without dad, and he told me to wait him anyway.\n\n In two o'clock buses arrived to our house, and all of our neighbors began to rapidly enter them. Militia men helped them, they were very nervous, shouted something and ran from  bus to bus. Then they entered our house, knocking all the doors and mine too!!! \n\nI just crawled off the bed, being there like an hour. Militia men knocked to the door, rang the bell and then went to other doors. I'm scared. I'm afraid that they'll come back, find me and take away, so I'll be lost. I looked out the window. The street is empty, just sometimes green military cars passing by, looked like small tanks with wheels. Frightful people in gray suits and with gasmasks come from them, fumble with sticks over grass and then leave. In the evening, one of them put at our house some little yellow triangular plate, I can not see what's on it. I wanted to call someone, to find out where dad is, but phone didn't work anymore. And no electricity. I'm afraid. I pulled my old doll Masha out of the closet while it's bright around here. I would spend the night with her, I'm afraid of being alone but not with Masha. I imagine that she is afraid, and I comfort her, and I'm not so scared in that way. The sun is setting. \n\nApril 28\n\nNight was scary, streets were quiet, but I woke up from some strong buzz. And in the morning I saw helicopters flying over the city. Many and often. They fly to the dad's station and back, carrying something. No power, gas was disconnected too, only water is still on. I ate cold soup and the refrigerator dripped and defrosted. What should I do if my dad will not come back? Products will spoil soon, and I will have nothing to eat. I'm afraid to go out, dad said not to go, and military men walk in the streets only in rubber suits, but I do not have any. Scary. \n\nApril 29\n\nToday morning water is gone and I couldn't wash my face. Ate some bread, don't know whether I can eat what's left in the fridge or not. Probably I'll have to go out, I'm very hungry.\n\nReturned from the streets. At first I couldn't leave the house, the front door was locked. I cried, pushed the doorm for a long time, but then I remembered that there is a window between first and second floor that opens easily. I opened it, climbed to porch's roof and then on the tree nearby. Got some scratches, dad wouldn't be happy. There is no one in the city! No one at all! It's empty and scary around, I  can't hear a single sound. Only dogs are running around, when I went to the grocery store, I was followed by three dogs that stuck with me.</text>

		<text>Grocery store is opened but there is no one inside. I've got some crusty bread, conserves and lemonade, I need to eat. School is closed and I can't go to class. Then it was hard to reach home, window was too high. I cried but then I saw old ladder near the wall that was brought by some neighbour for painting. Ladder was heavy, I've got to pull it on a wall. It was hard, I've pulled it for about an hour but then it was fast to reach home. Helicopters still flying over the city and military men are in the streets also. There is almost no smoke over dad's station, but dad's not at home. Scary. I'm talking with Masha so I'm not afraid. Almost.\n\nJune 1\n\nThere were no interesting things yesterday and today I'm happy - cat Lucy came to me from the sixth floor. She was abandoned too, so she was hungry. I gave her some conserve food. No power, no water so far. I was with Lucy and Masha all day, we played and talked. I've got used to talk with Masha, when we talk it appears that she actually answers me. It's silly but I'm not afraid that way. Another bad thing - no water and no toilet. I'm enduring and when I can't, I go outside. When will dad return? Its been five days. I didn't feel so well, feel pain in my head and my stomach. In the evening I saw men with rifles in the yard, they shot at doggies and put them in car. I held Lucy tight, she was afraid and scraped me. I thought the men can shoot her too and didn't let her go.\n\nJuly 4 or 5\n\nI've got sick, feel bad. Can't get out of bad. Bad dreams, Lucy and Masha helped me. Lucy rumbled, Masha talked with me and treated me. Or maybe this was in my dreams. Today I managed to go out from bed and eat something and drink lemonade. My look in the mirror scares me, my hair fell out partly, hands are itchy. Dad didn't come back, I'm scared. Argued with Masha, she said something about "radiation sickness" and that I can die if I don't find help.\n\nThink, July 6\n\nI feel better but now I have no hair so I can't look myself in the mirror. Just want to cry. Masha says that I should find help, that I should talk with men in tank, they're good and will help me. Now I wait for tank then I'll run out and start to cry. I want to take Masha or Lucy with me, I can't take both, I'm weak. Masha is begging me to take Lucy. I cried a lot, don't want to leave Masha, but she may be right. Lucy is alive and she is not. I left note and penciil to Masha. Oh, there's a tank in the end of the street. I've got to go...\n\n(illegibly, different writing, very small block letters)\n\nShitty reactor, much radiation, and already... (illegibly)... all the city with shit, there is no way soon... (illegibly)... poor Tanya, looks like she took large radiation dose, I barely saved her... (illegibly)... dad is good man, I found in medkit all I need...

(illegibly)... when they say her. They took... (illegibly)... in chempro material, placed in tank and very fast... (illegibly)... medical unit...\n\nHope it's not so late, she can... (illegibly)...\n\n... (illegibly)... live long without Tanya, power is draining out... (illegibly)... take far away, may be in Moscow, in hospital... (illegibly)... fine, just in time... (illegibly)...... (illegibly)... why I'm writting this, no one will read it... (illegibly)...\n\ndfsdg sdfgg</text>
