		<text>Yeah, there's a military base now. I'm not sure how many of them there are exactly but it's at least a platoon. They're well-armed and you've got no chance of breaking through - they'll take you down before you can say "hello, comrades". The best way of getting in is during the night 'cause the base is well-guarded during the day - they got checkpoints everywhere. By the way, I've heard of a deserter-soldier from that base hiding in the marshes. If you can find him I'm sure you can shake some useful info out of him.</text>

		<text>The exit from the railway tunnel is nearby. It's fairly safe in the dead end. At least nobody has been eaten while sleeping... yet.  Also, to the Northwest of the factory you'll find a marsh with a wagon in it.  But be careful, there's a shitload of radiation around it, so it's best to approach it from the western side. Oh, and one more thing: a soldier has been spotted there. He's likely to be from the military base at the Institute. The poor bastard is probably crazy - he's been there for a couple of days and I doubt he'll survive much longer on his own.</text>

		<text>Tell me about this place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_1">
		<text>This is the area around the Agroprom Research Institute. The Institute itself is to the Southwest. The factory, which served as the Institute's technical production facility, is to the North. The buildings have been abandoned for a long time and there's nothing to be found there, but the army has been searching there very actively recently.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_2">
		<text>Tell me more about the Institute.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_21">
		<text>There are loads of legends about the Institute. Before the accident in 1986 the only thing here was the Institute of Crop Selection and Genetics. The area where the factory is now was used for experimental crop fields. After the accident, they closed the Institute and burned the fields. Then they remembered about it, whitewashed the building, put up a fence around it and built some barracks. I don't know what they did at the Institute but they didn't have any shortage of funding, that's for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_3">
		<text>Tell me more about the factory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_31">
		<text>The factory was built at the end of the 80s. They said it was going to be used to build and test machines that could treat soil affected by radiation. As far as I know, nobody ever saw a single machine come out of that plant. It's totally empty now, which makes it a favorite spot for stalkers. I hear the place is pretty safe as long as you avoid the dark corners.</text>

	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_4">
		<text>Thank you.</text>

		<text>What are you going to do now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_20">
		<text>I am from the recon unit. They sent us into the catacombs to see what's going on below the base. It's hell down there, I'm telling you. I was the only one to get out of there... everyone else is probably dead by now. I don't want to go back to the base - those bastards are always using us to plug up all the holes in this damn Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_30">
		<text>Underground tunnels. They go from the Institute to the area around it - I'll show you the entrances. I don't have maps of the catacombs themselves.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_40">
		<text>At the HQ. It's on the third floor of the Institute. That's where they keep those damn papers. But it's a mission getting there. By day, the area is teaming with patrols but not as much at night. I'll tell you this for free: if you wanna get inside you'll have to go through the catacombs - you stand no chance at the gate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_50">
		<text>Hmm. I don't know. I am a deserter according to the military code and I need to get out of the Zone somehow. When we first got here there was a Zaporozhets in the garage that was almost working. I brought it back to life in half an hour but that damn captain took it for himself claiming he should have it according to the code. He drove it along this road and dumped it in the rain by the gate. If only I could get that car - making a run away from here is much safer on wheels!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_6">
		<text>Well, I can guide you without a car. To the Cordon trader, for example.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_7">
		<text>It would be wonderful! But it's not so easy - I don't want to be spotted by stalkers. Maybe some disguise would work. Otherwise I'll get shot, that's for sure. So, you bring me some ordinary stalker outfit and than we'll go to the Cordon. Deal?\n Oh, and another thing. There were rumours in my unit that the intelligence had found a safe path between the Agroprom and the Cordon. Some small trail or something. All reports are kept by our commander, in his blue box on the 3rd floor. I think, the intelligence report is there as well. If you find it, it can help us. So try to find the report if you pay a visit to the Agroprom Institute.</text>

		<text>Deal, I'll bring it. Wait here.</text>
